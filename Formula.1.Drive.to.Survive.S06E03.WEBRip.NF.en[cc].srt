1
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,640
[Walsh] Hope isn't a strategy.

2
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,080
We've gone backwards.

3
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,080
{\an8}The brand cries out for more performance.

4
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,480
{\an8}I mean, we did go backwards last year.
No denying.

5
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,820
[Stallard] <i>Okay, Daniel. That's P17.</i>

6
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,160
<i>Not the race we wanted, to be honest.</i>

7
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,000
[Ricciardo groans]

[commentator 1] <i>Lando Norris
really wrestling that McLaren.</i>

10
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,960
[Joseph] <i>P13.</i>

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,200
[Norris] No one's gonna like
being where we are, so far back.

12
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,200
In Formula 1, if you're not
moving forwards, you're going backwards.

13
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,300
And... And all the headlines
became driver related.

14
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,340
It was interesting though.

15
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,140
There was a lot of discussion
that it was purely drivers.

16
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,740
What was really going on there?

17
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,280
[tense music continues]

-[Walsh] We knew we had to make changes.
-Yeah.

22
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,140
But the important thing is,

23
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,840
having made those changes,

24
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,200
this season,
we've gotta show real progress.

25
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,680
Uh, first of all, we all feel
the pressure. We have some fixing to do.

26
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,080
But I've got
a lot of confidence in this team.

27
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,740
I think we need to give them
some... some time.

28
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,280
Things don't happen overnight.

29
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,200
It's got to work.

00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,080

[Norris] I want the rice cakes.
Then can I have some water?

34
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,020
{\an8}Wow.

35
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,580
Season six.

36
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,040
All right.

37
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,060
It's gonna be a... a fun year.

38
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,280
[producer] That was terrible. One more.

39
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,320
[Norris laughs and sighs]

40
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,580
[producer] Did you break it?

41
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,700
[funky music plays]

42
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,340
{\an8}[Brown] See you later. Cheers.

43
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,760
Launch days are always fun.

44
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,520
And long.

45
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,600
[man] And long.

46
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,880
[Norris] Every season you start,
you get excited.

47
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,580
You're like, "Maybe this is the year
that we can turn things around,

48
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,920
and I can be in that position where
I'm standing on the podium more often

49
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,120
and fighting against Ferrari and Red Bull,
fighting against Mercedes."

50
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,600
I'm excited to see how things go.

51
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,240
We've had a lot of changes
within the team.

[woman 1] Can you go in the side door?

55
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,760
[Norris] Oscar Piastri.

56
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,100
Uh, another Aussie.

57
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,740
He's probably got one of the best CVs
out of any young driver

58
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,620
almost ever coming into Formula 1.

59
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,700
For a day-one car launch,
6 a.m. call time,

60
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:17,700
I'll forgive a couple of minutes late
because that's quite brutal, I appreciate.

61
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,940
-[Piastri] Morning.
-[woman 2] Morning.

62
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,560
Right, we're just in here.

63
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,040
[Piastri] Has Lando rocked up yet or...

64
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,220
[woman 1] He has, yeah.

65
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,920
And he did make a point that he beat you.
Arrived before you.

-[man] <i>Bienvenido.</i>
-[woman 1] Morning.

68
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,440
[Brown] What's going on?
Glad you could join us.

69
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,380
[Piastri] Sorry I'm late.

70
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,060
[laughter]

71
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,740
[Norris] I'm gonna be the veteran.

72
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,580
I'm the old guy. He's the young guy.

73
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,760
It's the first time in my career
I've kind of had that sort of pressure.

74
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,660
...in F1 with McLaren.

75
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,020
Um, I've been building up to it,
and like you said...

76
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,280
Oscar's quite tall, huh?

77
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,060
Your apprentice.

78
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,660
He doesn't look tall, but he is tall.

79
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,980
...so it's been really good.
Everyone's been really welcoming.

80
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,660
[Norris] He's only, like, 15.

81
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,040
Where do you want us?

82
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,820
We have a new driver lineup this year.

83
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,920
Super excited to have Oscar.
Uh, 22 years old.

84
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,080
Uh, very mature, very smart, very fast.

85
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,960
Oh, hello.

86
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:30,200
And, uh, I'm excited to see
he and Lando, uh, racing each other hard

87
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,760
and pushing our team forward.

88
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:36,600
To be an F1 driver,
it's, uh, a very exciting prospect,

89
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,060
and, you know, definitely pinching myself

90
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,300
because it's something
I couldn't have dreamed of,

91
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,900
uh, even a couple of years ago.

92
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:50,560
[Stella] Welcome
to the private team reveal of our car.

93
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,940
Right. Show us the MCL60, please.

94
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,800
[Buxton] Coming into 2023,
Zak has everything he wants.

95
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,180
From a driver perspective,

96
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:07,200
{\an8}he has two young future world champions
at his team.

97
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,900
But the worry is he doesn't have the car.

98
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,200
[applause]

99
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,100
[Brown] Hello.

100
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,780
I love the offseason.

101
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,440
Uh, it's a great-looking car.

102
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,260
Um, we still have work to do,
as... as we know,

103
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,060
so as much as I'd like to sit here and go,

104
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,320
"This is the championship contender,"

105
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,120
we're, uh, still a little bit
aways from that.

106
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:37,960
We have some concerns over our race car,
especially some of the data we're seeing.

107
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,120
We know we're not where we want to be
and we've missed some of our targets,

108
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,880
so I am concerned
coming into the start of the year,

109
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,840
but we'll take some time to fix that.

110
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,820
Time to get the show on the road
in Bahrain.

111
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,520
Let's go racing.

112
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,180
[applause]

113
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,580
Car looks bitchin'.

114
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,540
McLaren cannot recover this
in the short-term.

115
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,900
It's going to take time.
It's going to take months.

116
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,140
[Norris] The floor's the same
as last year, isn't it?

117
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,760
That's bigger. That's about
all I can see that's different.

118
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,860
Yeah.

119
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,540
[Buxton] The question mark for Zak is

120
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:26,420
how are you gonna keep
two ambitious drivers loyal and committed

121
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,920
when you're launching a car

122
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,420
and you're telling everyone,

123
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,920
"We're not going to be competitive until
at least halfway through the season"?

124
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,260

[Norris laughs]

126
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,740
[woman] Were you happy with the launch?

127
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,420
[Norris] If we can do more than three laps
in a row, we've made a step forward.

128
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,040
-[laughs]
-[Norris] That was a joke. I'm joking.

129
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,280
I remember my first car launch.

130
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,420
-Been there, done that.
-Yeah.

131
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,180
Cut to Bahrain.

132
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,220
[tense music plays]

133
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,400
Starting your F1 career, it's exciting.
It's very nerve-wracking as well.

134
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,140
{\an8}But it's something you've dreamed of
since you were a little kid.

135
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,620
It all comes down to... to that moment.

-Yeah, all good.

138
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,980
{\an8}Going into my first race of the year,
there's a lot of pressure on.

156
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,320
[commentator 4] <i>He's shaking his head.
What a start.</i>

157
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,180
<i>What a miserable first grand prix
for Oscar Piastri.</i>

158
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,080
[Norris] Fucking hell.

159
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,500
[Joseph] <i>Box this lap.</i>

160
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,440
[commentator 1] <i>Lando Norris
is really struggling.</i>

161
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,640
[commentator 4] <i>He's coming into the pits
for the fifth time!</i>

162
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,900
[Joseph] <i>This will be a slow stop.
Twenty-five to 30 seconds.</i>

163
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,420
[Norris] Whoa.

164
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:13,680
[commentator 1] <i>Max Verstappen dominates
the Bahrain Grand Prix</i>

166
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,960
<i>and they will take some beating this year.</i>

167
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,920
[commentator 4] <i>Norris comes home in 17th.</i>

168
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,680
<i>And Piastri doesn't even finish
his debut race.</i>

169
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:41,300
I do one little thing. I under rotate.
Fucking corner, giving up.

170
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,460
Knife-edge.

171
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,660
Like, it's... it's still...

172
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,180
As soon as I do one thing wrong,
it's just garbage.

173
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,140
{\an8}I think every team goes
into every new season filled with hope.

174
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,760
And if your car is not
where you want it to be...

175
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,360
your heart just sinks.

176
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,160
'Cause you know it's going to be
the hardest of years.

177
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,640
[Brown] There's Lando.

178
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,560
And? Same as last year?

179
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,560
Similar limitations, basically.

180
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,440
Yeah.

181
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,440
Similar issues. Similar problems.

182
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,400
[Brown] All right.

183
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,020
We'll keep pushing.

184
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,600
{\an8}At every single point
in your career as a driver,

185
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,140
{\an8}you think,
"I need this year to go really well."

186
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,620
You don't feel like
you ever have a year to burn.

187
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,480
There's never a point in time
as a driver where you're thinking,

188
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,620
"Oh, no problem."

189
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:34,400
Like, "I'll be happy
to wait the rest of the season,

190
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,760
or until next year,
or a few more months for this to go well."

191
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,300
You need a good car now.

192
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,500
I might just walk into Red Bull
and steal their car.

193
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,820
-[man] Yeah? Okay.
-[Norris] Just steal their front wing.

194
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,880
-[man] They won't care, will they?
-[Norris] Pick it up, walk straight out.

195
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,360
Is it too soon to call it a crisis?

196
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,360
I know we're far from where we wanna be.

197
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:00,320
Um, but we have a very clear plan,
uh, what we need and want to achieve.

198
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,660
{\an8}[Norris] Guys, something's not right
with the front end.

199
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,020
{\an8}I got too much understeer.

200
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,460
[tense music plays]

201
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:25,040
[commentator 2] <i>The two McLarens,
last in the Constructors Championship,</i>

202
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,540
<i>and not doing much tonight</i>

203
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,340
<i>to get themselves
off the bottom of the table, it seems.</i>

204
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,320
{\an8}[commentator 1] <i>It's a real shame
for Lando Norris,</i>

205
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,260
{\an8}<i>a phenomenally talented driver.</i>

206
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,360
[Buxton] It's been clear for a long time

207
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,960
that Lando Norris
is the focal point of this team.

208
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,280
That he's their future.

209
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:48,800
But when you consider how poor
the car is that he's been given,

210
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,880
how long until he tries to find a way out?

211
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,400
[Horner] Lando's one of the most
talented drivers on the grid.

212
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,820
{\an8}In the right car, he would be
a winning driver. No doubt of that.

213
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:09,080
Can his career take another year
of being in the doldrums?

214
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,940
A driver's career has
a finite amount of time to it,

215
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:16,840
and he needs to make the right decisions
for him at the end of the day.

216
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,180
We'd certainly be interested in him.

217
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,300
If he's delivering,
he's not gonna be short of choices.

218
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,420
He's gotta make sure
he makes the right choice.

219
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,360
[upbeat music plays]

220
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,680
Yeah, it's huge, huh?

221
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,480
How cool is that?

222
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,000
[music stops]

223
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,260
-[Brown] How are you?
-Good.

224
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,680
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

225
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,040
What's going on?

226
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,340
Coming into Miami, I think Zak
has every reason to be worried.

227
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:08,440
Because those clamors

228
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,900
for Lando Norris's signature

229
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,720
are only going to get louder.

230
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:22,120
[Williams] People in F1
love to see other teams' weaknesses.

231
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,620
If team principals see the cracks
and they think,

232
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,780
"Lando Norris might be available,"

233
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:31,560
you know, his head might be turned
by a phone call from Christian Horner.

234
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,040
And why wouldn't it be?

235
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,360
[Horner] I admire
Lando's loyalty to McLaren,

236
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,980
but, at some point, that will wear thin.

237
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,420
I think he would fit
in our environment longer term.

238
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,900
Uh, he and Max have a good respect
and good relationship together.

239
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:53,520
So you could see that being
a combination that could work.

240
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,560
[both laugh]

241
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,740
[reporter] Zak, great to see you.
Thanks for joining us.

242
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:58,720
[Brown] Good to be here.

243
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,640
[reporter] What's all this talk about
having to say, "Lando is with us to stay"?

244
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,120
Doesn't that seem too early?

245
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,680
Yeah, it's very early.

246
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,040
But, you know, people get
asked a question and, uh, speculate.

247
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,680
You have a bad two races,

248
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,040
and, "Oh my God.
He's off to another team."

249
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,140
A lot of times in this sport,
people will put certain rumors out

250
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:20,200
to try and, uh,
put fractures into relationships

251
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,920
to destabilize, uh, teams
and... and drivers.

252
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,140
-Thank you very much, Zak.
-You're welcome. See you later. Cheers.

253
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:31,540
I just wanna make sure Lando stays focused
and that we block out all the nonsense

254
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,000
that, uh, some of our competitors
like to create.

255
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,520
[woman] I think this will be quite quick.

256
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,400
The first order of business is obviously

257
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,880
it's not as bad as it looks
after the first races.

258
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,280
I think that's quite important.

259
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,060
As a team,
we wanna improve the performance.

260
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,760
-We know we're not where we need to be.
-Yeah.

261
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,440
And I think that's probably as deep
a level as you need to get into it.

262
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,040
The only other thing to flag
is on Lando's contract.

263
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:04,620
So Zak got asked specifically outright
by Sky if there was any exit clauses,

264
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,820
to which we said no.

265
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,300
I'm probably dead
by the time your contract is up.

266
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,780
[woman] Yeah. Just avoid it.

267
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,960
Um, just anything that you can say again

268
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
which is just... cementing
that, as a team, we're knuckling down.

269
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,720
We're not listening to any noise
going on in the media.

270
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:25,160
-We're just focused on our journey.
-Contract or not, we're all on a mission.

271
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,800
That's it.

272
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,420
Um, any other questions
or concerns from your side?

273
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,200
[both drivers] No.

274
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,980
[woman] Zak, do you have anything else
you want to add just from your side?

275
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,580
-No.
-[woman] Cool. Let's have a good one.

276
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,140
[Piastri] Yeah.

277
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,560
[woman] Are you gonna be
in your room, Lando?

278
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,500
I shall be, yeah.

279
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,060
[Norris] At times I would love to know

280
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,220
what it's like
to be in other people's positions.

281
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,400
I think, like, "Hmm."

282
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,720
"What would happen if I went here?"
Or, "What if I went there?"

283
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,940
I guess I think of those things.
Who wouldn't think of those?

284
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:09,240
Every driver has conversations
with as many people as they can

285
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,540
to give themselves options.

286
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,080
I should be in a better car, but I'm not.

287
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,300
Things are always shit, you know.

288
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:18,520
It's rare you get one driver that sticks
with the same team their whole career.

289
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,680
If you were a betting man, would you say
you'd still be there next year?

290
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,800
[Norris] Um...

291
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:30,340
-[man chuckles] That's a bit of a no.
-No comment.

292
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,160
There's no smoke without fire
in Formula 1.

293
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,880
These rumors exist
because the interest is there.

294
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:42,540
To be Max's teammate in the future
would be something I'm definitely up for.

295
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,320
The pressure on Zak will be building.

296
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,240
-[man 1] Better. Better now.
-[man 2] Nice.

297
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,460
[Brown] What's up, dude?

298
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,000
-Get some warm-up.
-One sec.

299
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,700
Someone tell you we were going bowling
or are those golf shoes?

300
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,980
[Norris] Lovely golf shoes.

301
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:07,940
[Brown laughs]

302
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,400
-[Brown] Cool. Game on.
-[man] Good luck. Let's play.

303
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:16,960
[Brown] Nice drive.

304
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,240
Oh, that's not good!

305
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,340
I'm not in the water.

306
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,580
[man] Went over the water.

307
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,700
Yeah. Other side. Next to the alligators.

308
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,640
Let's see if I can find it.

309
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,840
How we gonna go in Miami?

310
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,400
I don't know.

311
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,660
We're so slow on the straight.

312
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,980
[Brown] So look,
I know this year's a tough start.

313
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:50,480
-[Norris] Yeah.
-But, um, the car not being fast enough,

314
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,000
I would imagine it is

315
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,140
pretty frustrating.

316
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,620
[Norris] Yeah. Like, we're McLaren, right?

317
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,900
So... we should be a team
that's fighting Ferrari and...

318
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:00,780
[Brown] Yeah.

319
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,580
...Red Bull, Mercedes.

320
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,900
-Like, we should be up there leading them.
-Yeah. No, I get it.

321
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,100
[Norris] So when we come into a season,
and it's a bit,

322
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:12,580
you know, we're not gonna be fighting
for top, you know, four teams...

323
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,060
-Yeah.
-...it's tough.

324
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,920
[Brown] We need to give you
a better race car.

325
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,560
I know there's been a lot of noise,

326
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,160
but we've been doing this now together
seven, eight years?

327
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,260
I think we'll, uh, we'll get there,
and then it'll be so much more sweet.

328
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,700
Let's beat all those guys.

329
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,160
I'll do my best, as always.

330
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,120
Let's hope our racing's
better than our golf.

331
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,460
[laughs] 100%!

332
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,340
[both laugh]

333
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,720
[Norris] I can't imagine
what it's like to be in Zak's position.

334
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,400
You know, running McLaren. Um...
Of course, it's...

335
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,680
There has to be a huge amount of pressure
that comes with it.

336
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,140
Shit, that went much further
than I thought.

337
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,140
[Norris] But when you put
so much effort into it,

338
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:04,360
and the best you can do is,
like, a 17th or 18th,

339
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,760
it feels like you're racing for nothing.

340
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,000
Fuck. This is quicker than our car, this.

341
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,960
[tense music plays]

342
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,840
[team member 1]
We should put those in there.

343
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,800
[team member 2]
It's like we've done it before.

344
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,240
[tense music continues]

345
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,920
This, by any metric,

346
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,080
has been a horrible start
to the season for McLaren.

347
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,500
Do the drivers want to stay
and race for you?

348
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,360
Do the sponsors want to hang around?

349
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:50,100
With where McLaren are now,
Zak's hoping for a miracle.

350
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,120
[Brown] All good.

351
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,200
Good luck. Yeah?

352
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,680
Let's... We'll need it.

353
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,140
[commentator 4] <i>It's time
to go racing in the USA.</i>

354
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,280
<i>From Miami in Florida,</i>

355

356

357
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,460
Red Bull! Red Bull!

358
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,060
[Brown] Fucking hell. We need points.

359
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,320
[commentator 1] <i>Just look at the crowd.</i>

360
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,140

[commentator 4]
<i>There's Lando Norris down in 16th.</i>

363
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,100
<i>He will desperately be looking for
a turnaround in fortunes here today.</i>

364
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:31,360
<i>Oscar Piastri starting
on the back row in 19th.</i>

about his awkward debut season?</i>

366
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,380
{\an8}[García] <i>Radio check, Lando.</i>

367
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,120
{\an8}All good.

00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,220
-[Stallard] <i>Have a good race.</i>
-[Piastri] Cheers.

[suspenseful music plays]

370
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,220
[Norris] I got hit. Rear.

[Joseph] <i>Lando,
everything looks okay.</i>

<i>Early overtake available.</i>

374
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,540
[Norris] Yeah. I'm... I'm trying.

375
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,580
[tense music plays]

376
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,980
-[Norris] I can't get past him.
-[Joseph] <i>Understood.</i>

[commentator 1] <i>Lando Norris knows

<i>Verstappen round the outside.

382
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,920
[tense music continues]

383
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,640
[Verstappen] Do I just keep it up for now?

384
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,400
[Lambiase] <i>Yep, copy.
You've got Piastri ahead.</i>

{\an8}[Norris groans]

393
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:54,300
[Norris] Fucking hell. We clearly
don't have the pace of the cars around.

394
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,900
I don't know
what race I'm in at the minute.

395
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,480
[Joseph] <i>I know this is frustrating,
but this is a good place for us.</i>

396
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,880

397
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,860
[Norris] Ha ha. Okay.

398
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,200
LOL.

404
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,180
[Piastri] Yeah. Just struggled for pace.

405
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,620
{\an8}[Norris] Felt pretty terrible,
but best we could do today.

406
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:47,340
I'm not suggesting it may look bad.
I'm suggesting it is bad.

407
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,640
[Horner] I think Zak's under pressure.

408
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,020
Inevitably, Formula 1's
a pressure business.

409
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,200
If you're not delivering,
you're under pressure.

410
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,160
He's been talking a big game.

411
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,080
When you don't deliver
and you get found out,

412
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,500
that's embarrassing, and it hurts.

413
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,420
The drivers, it's tough for them.

414
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,200
{\an8}When we see drivers in Formula 1,
you... you tend to forget

415
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,600
{\an8}that the journey started
when they were five or six years old.

416
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,800
And this sport is all about winning.

417
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,880
Lando can win.

418
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,860
If the car is capable of winning,
from a talent point of view,

419
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,000
uh, absolutely.

420
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,440
[reporter] There goes Lando.

421
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,040
[Norris] I don't have time.

422
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,920
[Patrick] It's a tough one in racing.

423
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,000
The loyalty that you have with your team
and the passion to win.

424
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:49,640
Um, but if the right opportunity
comes knocking...

425
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,980
sometimes you just go.

426
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,380
-[Russell yawns]
-[Norris] I love an early morning.

427
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:06,400
Oh, fucking hell. We've got
a McLaren logo on the side of a jet.

428
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,280
Let's go.

429
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:13,320
-[Russell] This is really nice. Wow.
-[Norris] Yeah, mate. It's frickin' mint.

430
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,220
[Russell] Silky.

431
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,640
-Need to have a word with Toto.
-[laughs] Yeah.

432
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,720
-Okay?
-[Russell] We good?

433
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,460
How are you? Very good, and you?

434
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:27,180
-[Norris] Let's go out tonight.
-Out out?

435
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,920
[Norris] Joking.
I'd never do such a thing.

436
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,160
[Russell] It was in my Williams contract.

437
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,080
You weren't allowed to drink
during the weekend.

438
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:37,280
Not gonna say names, but there's
definitely some people who drink.

439
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,880
-[Norris] You think?
-I know!

440
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,860
[chuckles] I've seen it.

441
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,820
-During a normal race weekend?
-[Russell] Yeah!

442
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,460
They're paying me off not to... not to tell.

443
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,120
-Not you, Lando.
-Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

444
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,380
[Russell] Yeah. I was
rewatching, um, Miami.

445
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,940
-[Norris] We were so bad.
-Yeah, you... [laughs]

446
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:01,220
-Like, we were last.
-Yeah. I didn't wanna say it, but yeah.

447
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,300
I mean, it was bad, wasn't it?

448
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,320
Horrendous.

449
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,780
-That's every weekend, man.
-[Russell] I know.

450
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,420
And away we go.

451
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:19,340
[Norris] This is the worst start
to any season I've had.

452
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,500
I wanna be the best driver there is
in Formula 1.

453
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,320
That's why I started my whole journey.

454
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,920
Hi. I'm Lando Norris.
I'm European champion,

455
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,580
and I race KF-Junior.

456
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,880
[older Norris] This is what
we're born to do, what we've grown up

457
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,860
spending pretty much our whole life
trying to achieve.

458
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,480
I need to be stronger.

459
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,780
Um, and not make so many mistakes.

460
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,920
[older Norris] I'm in that position
that I saw on TV and dreamt of being in.

461
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,420
[tense music plays]

462
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,980
[Brown] Lando and I go back a long way.
Prior to McLaren.

463
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:10,220
First time I met Lando,
he was a small 14-year-old.

464
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,660
He and his father came in,
and he was very nice.

465
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,980
He was very shy,
as you would expect a 14-year-old.

466
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,080
He was very fast.

467
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,500
I think the first time
he drove a race car,

468
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,840
it was probably mine.

469
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,820
The dream is
to win world championships together.

470
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:29,800
So if we fall short of that
and see him do that in someone else's car,

471
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,040
that would be
personally quite disappointing.

472
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,140
You know, we've done so much together.

473
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,780
[Norris] My goal is to win races.

474
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,600
I would love to create the story

475
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,980
and finish the story and everything
with McLaren.

476
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,580
I really would love that.

477
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,580
Sometimes, you gotta make decisions
that are the best for you and your career.

478
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:56,340
If you wanna achieve success,
if you wanna win races, win championships,

479
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:59,140
sometimes things have to change,
as much as you don't want them to.

480
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,100
[man] Hearing rumors around Lando.

481
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,820
{\an8}You know, given the performance,
the driver rumors...

482
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,240
{\an8}We thought it might be useful
to come together.

483
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,760
{\an8}I mean, it's been
a... tough start to the season.

484
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:23,240
{\an8}I think just... we just need to take back
the... the story to the team.

485
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,700
Look, I know you're concerned,

486
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,460
and you have reason to be concerned.

487
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,440
[Rafique] Look, Zak,
you know I support you.

488
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,120
I support the team.
But this is our biggest sponsorship.

489
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,400
We're getting a lot
of questions asked internally.

490
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,780
"Was this the right move?"

491
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,060
"How long does
the performance stay at this level?"

492
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,980
I know you placed, um, a few big bets.

493
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:49,700
And this is a big one.
And it needs to, uh, pay off.

494
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,500
And we need to get results for you.

495
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:55,200
[Buxton] Zak's got a lot of questions
to answer right now.

496
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,960
Sponsors, they're gonna want to see
that step up the ladder

497
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,280
towards the competitive,

498
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,600
consistently performing edge
that Zak will have promised them.

499
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,940
-Good. See you guys later.
-Bye, Zak.

500
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:10,820
[Buxton] They will want a guarantee
Lando Norris is going nowhere.

501
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,940
[tense music plays]

502
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,020
[Brown] Morning.

503
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,700
You know, we're under big pressure, um...

504
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,080
Everyone's expected
a much stronger season.

505
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,920
Emotionally, it... it makes you frustrated.

506
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,140
Uh, makes you angry.

507
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,720
But also, at the end of the day,
you gotta fix the problem,

508
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,240
so what I am is highly motivated
to fix the problem.

509
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,840
-Morning, guys.
-Morning, Zak.

510
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,720
All good?

511
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,300
How, uh... How are we coming along
with the upgrades?

512
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,920
[man] Well, development is going well.

513
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,740
Um, but the redesign of the car is, um,

514
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:02,040
kind of bigger than what we anticipated,

515
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,580
because, uh, we are redesigning underneath

516
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,440
quite a lot of the mechanical part.

517
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,040
So it is a big undertaking for the team.

518
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,600
There's also,
from a mechanical point of view,

519
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,040
some risks associated
with having redesigned the car so much.

520
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,460
And, obviously, there's the reliability.

521
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,980
The reliability aspect with the redesign.

522
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:26,860
[Brown] Yeah.

523
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,500
So, due for Silverstone, you reckon?

524
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:33,880
Um, we are working hard
to have two cars in Silverstone.

525
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,720
Fingers crossed, yes.

526
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,680
There's still, uh, a few challenges
that we need to overcome

527
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,260
to actually deliver,

528
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,220
physically, the project on track.

529
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:44,680
-We will see soon.
-Yep. Thanks, guys.

530
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:51,920
[Williams] The likelihood of a team being
able to turn around their performance

531
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,760
to any kind of significant degree

532
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,160
during a season,

533
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,500
I can't tell you how difficult it is.

534
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,020
It's pretty much unheard of.

535
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,700
[Brown] I always have worries.

536
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,840
I know the consequences
for us not performing.

537
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,460
If you don't perform, you're not gonna
have top-line drivers that wanna race.

538
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,100
If I don't deliver,

539
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,720
I think we all know what happens.

540
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,360
[Paul] Just tell me
where we're at because,

541
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,160
you know, it hasn't been

542
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,620
the most impressive start.

543
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:32,700
[Brown] I think we started slower
than I'd anticipated.

544
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,140
How do the drivers feel?

545
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,820
Pretty frustrated.

546
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,720
I think Lando more than... than Oscar.

547
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,960
I... I get it. I'm frustrated.

548
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,300
Uh, partners are frustrated.
Everyone's frustrated.

549
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,300
Realistically,

550
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,620
what if these upgrades don't deliver?

551
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,780
[Brown] We'll have

552
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,740
pretty upset drivers

553
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,900
that we'll need to manage.

554
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,420
It's not lost on me

555
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,760
where we're at right now.

556
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,780
-You gotta keep the pressure on everyone.
-[Brown] Yep.

557
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,640
Uh, I don't wanna be brutal,

558
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:10,400
but we... we need to deliver.

559
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,620
-Yeah.
-We've put a lot of investment.

560
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,360
-We need to see the results.
-[Brown] Yeah.

561
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:16,900
Loud and clear.

562
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,480

[camera shutters clicking]

[photographer] Can you get out
either side of that thing?

-What's that?
-[photographer] You get out either side?

[Brown] What are they gonna say
in the press conference?

576
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,180
There'll be a little bit about, uh,

577
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,500
the progress that we've made
with upgrades.

578
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,400
[Brown] Yeah.

579
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,640
[team member] That's of huge interest
to the media at the moment.

580
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:22,240
Being a team boss when you're
not scoring points, it's horrific.

581
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,520
I can't describe the pressure
and what it feels like.

582
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:29,200
You've got the media writing stories.

583
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,860
TV cameras on you.

584
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,260
[Brown] We're showing up.
We wanna move forward, not backwards.

585
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:39,480
And then everyone that works for you
looks to you for change,

586
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,860
and you've gotta deliver it.

587
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,580
[Brown] This is a defining moment

588
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:51,160
for us to prove
to the world, to ourselves, our drivers,

589
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,300
that we're turning this team around.

590
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,820
We've tried to improve the car

591
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,740
in the areas in which
we know we have weaknesses.

592
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:03,520
But you start to beg the question of,
you know, how good are the upgrades?

593
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,880
[Norris] Success is your motivator.

594
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:18,100
So when you don't have any of it,
it's extremely tough.

595
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,280
You've kinda just gotta have faith
in your own abilities

596
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,420
and the team.

597
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,300
Maybe this car's... decent, you know?

598
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,100
Maybe we've turned a corner here.

599
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:32,800
But it could be
that it's the complete opposite.

600
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
[tense music plays]

601
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,460
[Piastri] There's always pressure.

602
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,320
When things are not going
as well as you hoped,

603
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,600
the pressure is... is even higher.

604
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,600
[tense music continues]

605
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:59,680
[Brown] I feel very responsible

Yeah, he will be. Yeah.

-That was good, eh?

644

-Well done.
-That was good.

645
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,560
Zak will celebrate this like a win.

646
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,520
But it's only Qualifying.

647
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,300
That's one lap.

648
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,540
The only true barometer

649
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,480
is the race.

650
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,500
And the drivers know that.

651
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:33,800
Do you think a podium
is on the cards, Lando, at all?

652
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,580
-Um, on pure performance, no.
-Right. Okay.

653
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,500
[Norris] Got P2, but then
the race is a different story.

654
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,160
[reporter 1] This is supposed to be
your most major upgrade.

655
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,800
How optimistic are you about it?

656
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,500
I never get my hopes up, so...

657
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,620
[reporter 2] 'Cause you've had
too many false dawns?

You've had too many false dawns?

659
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,160
Yeah.

660
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,580
[reporter 3] Cheers, Lando.

661
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,640
[Brown] The performance
in Qualifying was awesome.

662
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,880
But we need to validate that in a race.

663
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,200
Have we made the upgrade,
the step forward that we think we have?

664
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,360
Now we need to close the deal.

665
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:33,820
{\an8}-[Joseph] <i>Okay, Lando. Radio check.</i>

668
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,360
Big day for us as a team.

669
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,780
We're a bit in the unknown
of how well we could do.

670
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:00,800
{\an8}[Piastri] I'm starting third on the grid.

671
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:04,480
{\an8}But the car honestly
doesn't feel that much different.

672
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,020
When you compare it against other people,
you really see the difference.

00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:15,320
Come on, baby!

757
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,280
[Brown] Yes!

758
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,040
[laughs]

759
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:18,920
Yes!

760
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:23,580
[Brown] To have both our guys
right up at the front was awesome.

761
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:25,280
Never in doubt, never in doubt!

762
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:29,700
And to think here we are
after the season we had is... is phenomenal.

763
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:31,960
We've earned it.
We've done it the hard way.

764
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,220
And so it is,
I think, to a certain extent,

765
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:36,740
more fulfilling
than if we started the season strong.

766
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,080
All right, let's go to a podium!

767
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,140
Let's go see my boy Lando!

768
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,620
-[man] Good job, Zak.
-[Brown] Thank you.

769
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:46,700
Let's go see him!

770
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:51,940
Dude, I didn't wait this long
to walk to the podium!

771
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,980
[laughter]

772
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,300
[Brown] Excuse me.

773
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,220
Excuse me. Excuse me.

774
00:44:59,080 --> 00:44:59,940
Excuse me.

775
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:03,480
[Brown sighs and laughs]

776
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,140
How'd you like those hard tires, man?

777
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,620
[Brown laughs]

778
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:10,760
Finishing second in Silverstone
was one of the best days of my life.

779
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:12,720
Like, without a question.

780
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:14,900
[uplifting music plays]

781
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:16,840
[cheering]

782
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,640
Emotional, just 'cause
it's a lot of stress and relief

783
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:21,520
for everyone.

784
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:26,500
Yeah! Woo!

785
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:28,400
I can literally
picture it all so perfectly.

786
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:31,480
And we did what we needed to do.

787
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,660
We put ourselves
back on the map as a team.

788
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:38,180
I have no idea what it's like
to win a Formula 1 race.

789
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,940
Um, 'cause I've never done it.

790
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:43,120
[photographer] One, two, three.

791
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:45,280
[all cheer]

792
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,780
Gonna just bide my time,

793
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:49,600
but, uh, I know my time's coming.

794
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,680
It's definitely gonna come, yeah. 100%.

795
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:02,420
{\an8}Not here to be last.

796
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,680
{\an8}-[Hülkenberg] Engine's gone.
-What the fuck?

797
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,100
Williams have taken a massive gamble
on a new team principal.

798
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:09,680
When you get data right,
that's how you move forward.

799
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:11,520
[Urwin] <i>P9. That's a bloody good job.</i>

800
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:14,960
[Steiner] Williams, boom, from nowhere.
We need to do something different here.

801
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,460
{\an8}[Buxton] Ferrari wanted a new direction,
and Fred represents that.

802
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:23,240
[commentator 2] <i>Sainz locks up,
and somehow they avoid contact.</i>

803
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,640
<i>That could have been awful for Ferrari.</i>

804
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,300
Watching your two drivers
battle on the track,

805
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:31,440
the TP needs to tell their drivers,
"Dial it down a bit."

806
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,480

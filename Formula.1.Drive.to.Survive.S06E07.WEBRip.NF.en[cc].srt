1
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,380
[Ocon] Very nice to meet you.
How are you doing?

2
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:14,720
-Good. How are you?
-Very good.

3
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,580
[Ryan Reynolds] It's the most exciting
sport. It's crazy how fast it's growing.

4
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,200
-[Ocon] It is.
-[Reynolds] It's also the...

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,880
The documentary
has been a gateway for so many people.

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,820
You've seen it?

7
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,400
-[Reynolds] Every single episode.
-Okay.

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,680
[Reynolds] My kids always laugh
because they go,

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,000
"Dad, you say you wanna relax.
All I hear is..."

10
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,800
-[Reynolds imitates an engine revving]
-[Ocon laughs]

11
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:35,940
[Ocon] Oh no. There's a new season coming.
Where are they?

12
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,900
-You are gonna be in the Netflix series.
-Hi!

13
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,520
-Finally!
-Finally. [chuckles]

14
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,340
Someone else's documentary.

15
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,940
[reporter] Hollywood actors Ryan Reynolds
and Rob McElhenney

16
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,700
are joining an investor group

17
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:00,160
taking a 24% equity stake
in Alpine Racing.

18
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,300
[man] Let's just take a picture
with <i>Cosmopolitan</i> magazine.

19
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:07,620
[Szafnauer] Oh wow.

20
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,560
Do you want my good side
or my really good side?

21
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,440
[woman laughs]

22
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,880
{\an8}Any level of significant investment
into your team

23
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,960
{\an8}is so extraordinarily welcome.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,080
But of course they're not just doing that
for the love of the sport.

25
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,200
They're not only doing it
for the love of your team.

26
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:30,200
They are doing it because they want
a significant return on their investment.

27
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,020
And that brings so much pressure

28
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,800
on a Formula 1 team principal

29
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,900
to perform immediately.

30
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,600
What was your reaction when you heard
that you were gonna have

31
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,240
some Hollywood stars involved?

32
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,940
Well, I know more about the car
and performance than I do Hollywood stars,

33
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,180
but they're a welcome addition.

34
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,420
Those investors have come in,

35
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,300
so it's important
to hit the targets that we set.

36
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,060
-There we go.
-Oh yeah!

37
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,040
[Szafnauer] But, uh, our season so far
has been disappointing.

38
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,880
[commentator 1] <i>Esteban Ocon
has been retired from the race.</i>

39
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:12,500
[in French] When we make the same mistakes
twice, that is not acceptable.

40
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,780
[commentator 2 in English] <i>Pierre Gasly
coming home in 19th.</i>

[commentator 1] <i>I mean, seriously,
could it get much worse?</i>

42
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,140
[in French] There is a state of mind
which is not up to

43
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,200
the level of what has been done
in the past by the same team.

44
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,020
[commentator 1 in English]
<i>There's contact!</i>

-What the fuck?

[commentator 3] <i>Both Alpines are out.</i>

47
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,520
[in French] We are concerned and focused.

48
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,940
[Szafnauer in English]
I can sense the pressure.

49
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,660
{\an8}If we're underperforming,
it's not good enough.

50
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,020
I have to do better.

51
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,900
The buck will stop with me.

52
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,380

[funky music plays]

55
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,700
{\an8}[in French] Hey, Tony.
We just arrived and we got my ticket.

56
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:32,080
And we're waiting for you.
I can't wait, to be honest. I'm excited!

57
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,120
[funky music continues]

58
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,460
-[in French] So nice to see you!
-Hey, how are you?

59
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,860
{\an8}-It's good to see you. Yes, I'm great.
-I'm trying to remember the last time...

60
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,940
{\an8}Yeah, that's crazy.
When was the last time we met?

61
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,080
I think it was in Miami
when I came to see you.

62
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,740
That was just a quick visit.

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,240
[Parker] How is your season going?

64
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,660
The season? Well, there's some good
and some less good.

65
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:14,220
[in English] This clearly hasn't been
the start that we would have liked.

66
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,960
I think, objectively,
we haven't been competitive enough.

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,560
The target is fourth.

68
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,660
And, at the moment, it doesn't look like
we're gonna be able to achieve it.

69
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,840
[in French] For my career,
I need things to be better right now.

70
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,720
[Parker] Is that possible?

71
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,660
[Gasly in English] Something
is not clicking somewhere.

72
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,660
Clearly, the communication
hasn't been to the best level.

73
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,200
And, um, I think it's something
very important, as a team principal,

74
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,340
is to understand
what your drivers actually need.

75
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,660
[Gasly in French] Let's go, guys.

76
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,900
[in English] So, uh,
now need to do the work and... and deliver.

77
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,720
{\an8}[in French] How are things in the team?

78
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,500
{\an8}I'm just in the middle.

79
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,820
{\an8}How do you stay focused, Esteban?
It must be hard.

80
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:26,880
{\an8}Well, it's... it's... There are always
things going on in the team.

81
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,660
I'm just focused on my role.

82
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,660
[Ocon in English] It's important
to work well, you know, inside the team.

83
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,640
To be... To have a close relationship,
in a way.

84
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,120
To... To talk about the things
that are important.

85
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,880
At the moment, we are not... doing that.

86
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,560
No one is happy inside the team.

87
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,600
I think Otmar needs
to find out some solutions.

88
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,460
[Buxton] It's about
halfway through the season,

89
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,560
{\an8}and Otmar has two drivers
who are not happy.

90
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,920
He needs to turn this season around.

91

[fan] Otmar, which of your drivers
do you prefer?

99
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,780
The one I prefer, and it changes,

100
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,420
is always the quicker one.

101
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,800
You know what I mean?

102
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:43,780
{\an8}[in French] We're aiming for fourth place,
but we're fifth.

103
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,940
{\an8}A long way off
in terms of performance and points.

104
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,940
That isn't what we were hoping for.

In Formula 1,

108
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,420
transforming a team to be
a, uh, championship contender takes time.

the building blocks in place

We shouldn't be trying to find excuses,

231

254

uh, the... the performance, the race pace
was actually pretty good.

So there... there were some...
some, uh, positives.

not scoring points is a negative

and you learn from 'em, and you move on.

It's all about results.

279
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,780
The two double DNFs in a row

280
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:25,680
took a huge number of points
off the board.

To have a, uh, a result slip away

287

[Famin in French] I don't like

Bad luck goes hand in hand
with not being good enough.

291
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,720
Starting from the middle of the grid,

292
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,620
you're more at risk of being involved
in collisions on the first corners.

293
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,820
We're trying to fight
for what few points we can,

294
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:27,180
and two double DNFs
is extremely frustrating.

295
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:32,600
The pressure is, of course, on Otmar
because he is the team principal.

296
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,380
[in English] To have
two race weekends in a row

297

where neither of your cars finish,

298
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:42,260
I mean, that's almost unheard of

Everyone in the garage,

the same thing, aren't we?

305
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,920
[man 2] It has been a focus point for us
and a sort of request and requirement

306
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,360

You're probably better off out of it.

[Williams] It's highly unusual to do this.

345
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,200
I'm not sure that I could ever recall
a time in Formula 1

Yeah.

350
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,580
I tried. I mean,
last year, we were fourth.

00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,520
Yeah, yeah, exactly. It's, like...

352
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,480
Not all of it,
but a bit of that was because of me.

353
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:46,400
[Famin in French] When we realized we were
very far from our performance goals,

354
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,300
we talked with Otmar
and the top management,

355
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:55,640
and we realized
we weren't on the same page

356
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,420
about the way we had to change things.

357
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,820
So we agreed
it was better to go our separate ways.

358
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,900
[Famin in English] Otmar!

-[Szafnauer] Good luck.
-[Famin] I will need it.

[Szafnauer] Alpine could have been
much more honest and transparent.

Sometimes, you take
two steps forward, one step backwards

-[man 2] Alunni Bravi, he speaks French?

[Famin] Yes, yes,
he speaks very good French.

380
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,280
So, the new boss, huh?

381
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,160
Yeah.

382
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:09,780
Yeah.

383
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,880
Yeah. Okay.

384
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,700
[Horner] It's a punchy decision.

385
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:18,700
{\an8}But Alpine is a mystery in many respects

386
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:21,120
{\an8}in terms of how
that team runs and operates.

387
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,040
I mean, let's see how that works out.

388
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,500
-[man 1] Bruno.
-[Bravi] Has he offered it to you?

389
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,640
{\an8}With Bruno coming in, everyone
wants to see how the new guy operates.

390
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,000
[Williams] You're coming in
halfway through a year,

391
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,840
and, by the way, you've never run
a Formula 1 team before.

392
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,200
Not easy.

393
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,920
That's a really difficult gig to take on.

394
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:48,480
And that team is gonna be
on its knees right now.

395
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,760
One of Bruno's first focuses

396
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,440
will have to be
how does he improve that morale?

397
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,820
He's not gonna get a morale boost
from performance on the racetrack.

398
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:01,120
It's gonna have to be done in another way.

399
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,500
[Famin] Okay, let's go.

400
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,520
-[man] After you.
-[Famin] Thank you.

401
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,600
-Good morning.
-[woman 1] Morning.

402
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,380
-Good morning.
-[woman 2] How are you?

403
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,400
Okay. So far.

404
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,500
[both chuckle]

405
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:33,400
[Famin in French] My goal is to change
the dynamic and morale of the team.

406
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,100
My leadership, the way I do things,

407
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:41,900
is I want to be close to the people.

408
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,220
Close to the team, and to stay in contact.

409
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,680
[Famin speaks French]

410
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,740
I need everyone to follow me
on this project

411
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,860
so we can perform as good as possible.

412
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:57,380
[Famin in English]
So, um, good afternoon, everyone.

413
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,440
Happy to be here.

414
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,280
Um, we are not making one step backward.

415
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,820
We are making a step forward.
We are pushing.

416
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:12,220
We have a lot of talented
and motivated people here,

417
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,760
and we need to design the best car

418
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,720
and to race it in the best way.

419
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,260
Together, we work and we race as one.

420
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,940
But I am super optimistic.

421
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,960
Working all together,

422
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,580
being always better,

423
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,080
uh, never satisfied,

425
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,740

426
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:37,740
Thank you.

427
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,720
[Gasly] Okay. <i>Allez.</i>

between Esteban and Pierre,

429
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:54,400
I realized that I had to do something.

430
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,380
[Ocon] Bonjour.

431
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,340
[Gasly] Bonjour.

432
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,260
We talked.

433
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:12,580
In talking about it quickly
between the three of us,

434
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:16,340
it allowed us to clear things up
and move on.

435
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,540
And there aren't going to be
any problems between them anymore.

436
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,780
And that gives us a very positive dynamic.

[Buxton in English] Bruno Famin
has a massive job on his hands.

[Famin] <i>Messieurs.</i>

440
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,820
The longer you go
without scoring points in Formula 1,

441
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:42,500
the... the more the pressure's gonna ramp up
on you, on the team.

442
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,260
[tense music continues]

443
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:49,460
[Buxton] He needs to turn around
what's been a very difficult season.

444
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:54,200
[Famin in French] There are
a lot of people in an F1 team,

445
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,740
but you have to know everybody,

446
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:02,240
and know their needs,
what their job is, and what it entails.

447
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,180
What are their difficulties
and how can you help them?

448
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:12,660
Make sure that everyone has what they need
in order to work well together.

449
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:17,180
We have a plan,
and will execute it and move forward.

450
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,800
But we know that the following races
will be difficult.

into the team.

466

Project Alpine is a huge responsibility,

477

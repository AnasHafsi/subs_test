-This here?

Is that any better?

My name is Otmar Szafnauer,

[man] T-shirt size?

7
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,260
Uh, XL.

8
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,140
Got it.

9
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,980
Uh, sorry, I'm miked up.
Ask me that again.

10
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,340
Uh, what T-shirt size?

11
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:43,740
-[Szafnauer] Medium.
-There you go.

[upbeat music plays]

13
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,680
[man] On behalf of Columbia University,
our entire sports-management program...

14
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:00,300
it is an incredible pleasure to welcome
a 26-year Formula 1 veteran,

15
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,360
Otmar Szafnauer.

16
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,660
Thanks for your time
and thanks for coming.

17
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:13,260
How do you choose
which drivers will join an F1 team?

18
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,300
You want the fastest drivers.

19
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,780
You also have to choose

20
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,340
from those that are available.

21
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,500
We already have Esteban Ocon.

22
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:26,300
And this season, I'm excited
because Pierre Gasly joins us.

23
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,960
{\an8}Usually, I always read what I sign.
Should I?

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,840
[laughter]

25
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,100
[team member] So you guys
are gonna be a great team?

26
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,780
[Szafnauer] We have great drivers.

27
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,780
I just need to get everyone
to pull in the same direction.

28
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,160
Species that collaborate

29
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,760
survive.

30
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,460
Species that are selfish go extinct.

31
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,640
High-performing teams are the same.

32
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,160
If you get it wrong, it bites you.

Hello.

37
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,260
It's Pierre Clooney.

38
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,880
Let's go, Netflix.

39
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,040
[in French] Do you prefer
high or low angle?

40
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,120
I prefer it like this. A little higher.

41
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,740
[photographer] Okay, that's good.

42
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,160
{\an8}[in English] Coming into the 2023 season,

43
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,760
{\an8}it's a huge change

44
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,800
{\an8}for me personally and in my career.

45
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,480
I've been with Red Bull Racing
or AlphaTauri for ten years.

46
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,500
[upbeat music plays]

47
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,560
My first win with AlphaTauri.

48
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,500
[cheering]

49
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,560
[Gasly] I scored the most points
of any driver in that team

50
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,420
in the entire history of Formula 1.

51
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,160
But...

52
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,820
[commentator 1] <i>And that's Gasly.
Gasly's out of the race.</i>

53
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,340
[Gasly] ...ultimately, as a driver,
what you want is a competitive car.

54
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,020
And I'll stop here.

55
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,220
It's impossible to win a championship
with... with AlphaTauri.

56
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,220
So I'm starting
this new project with Alpine.

57
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,660
Full of excitement
about this new chapter in my life.

58
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,260
[in French] I'm gonna take a selfie.

59
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,660
[Gasly in English] It is
a very unique story

60
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,780
to be able to come from Normandy,
where I'm from,

61
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,200
make it to Formula 1,

62
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,480
and after five seasons in F1,
join the only French team on the grid.

63
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,840
I really see huge potential in Alpine.

64
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,360
I think these opportunities
come along the way

65
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,800
as you reach the top of your sport.

66
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,700
{\an8}-I see you focused, but not stressed.
-Yeah.

67
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,160
{\an8}-Yeah, like, super focused, right?
-Uh-huh.

68
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,240
I got everything under control,

69
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,320
and I'm just excited to perform
and, uh, and to race.

70
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,200
[Gasly] Can't wait
to just get this season started.

71
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,400
What do you think of Agent 0010?

72
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,040
[in Portuguese] Beautiful. I love it.

73
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,640
-Very beautiful?
-Very beautiful.

74
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,780
[Gasly in English] We got another race
up the red carpet tonight.

75
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,640
[upbeat music plays]

76
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,620
[Gasly] Driving for Alpine
brings you to these places

77
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,940
where you're just... in a dream.

78
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,600
You think everything is surreal.

79
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,500
When you're going to Cannes

80
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:39,060
and you see all these people
going with incredible dresses,

81
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,980
like, insane watches,

82
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,720
and now, I've got the watch,
I've got the bow-tie.

83
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,960
-Got...
-I knew it! I know you so well!

84
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
-I've got the best girlfriend in town.
-I know you so well.

85
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,400
[photographers shouting]

86
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,740
[Gasly] Okay, so you're gonna
go first, babe.

87
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,800
It's just that I need to be on your left.

88
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,520
Ah, let's go then.

89
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,080
[upbeat music continues]

90
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,700
[Gasly] My sporting heroes are Zidane,

91
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,700
Ayrton Senna,

92
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,180
Michael Schumacher,

93
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,480
and Michael Jordan.

94
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,360
All these champions
became bigger than their sport

95
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,460
thanks to the success they had.

96
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,540
I do have a will to be, also,
more than just a sportsman.

97
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,420
But you don't become an icon
without the results.

98
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,400
So I need to be fighting for race wins.

99
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,080
[camera shutters click]

100
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,560
[Gasly] Crazy!

101
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,560
Welcome to my life.

102
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,540
[Buxton] For Pierre,
moving to Alpine is a huge opportunity.

103
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,520
But he's gonna have to
mark his own territory,

104
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,620
{\an8}because Pierre is stepping
into Esteban's playground.

105
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,280
[tense music plays]

106
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,180
-Morning.
-[woman] Good morning! How are you?

107
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,360
-Very good. You?
-[woman] Very well, thank you.

[tense music continues]

109
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,740
[in French] All right, let's go.

110
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,860
A new season is starting.

111
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,720
[producer in English]
Number one, here he is.

112
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,500
Number one. First one of the year.

113

-Here we go. [chuckles]
-[producer] The main man.

114
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,660
The main man? I don't know.
You tell me. [chuckles]

115
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,780
I'm Esteban Ocon,

116
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,560
{\an8}racing for Alpine F1 team.

117
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,320
Clap.

118
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,080
I feel good at Alpine.

119
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,880
You know, I've been since 2020.

120
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,380
I won a race. I finished on the podium.

121
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,520
And they count on me to be that leader.

122
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,660
[Buxton] Esteban Ocon is a shrewd operator

123
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,720
who, when it comes to his teammates,

124
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,580
doesn't always play nice.

125
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,280
We've seen that
at every team he's raced for.

126
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,040
{\an8}[commentator 2] <i>The two Force Indias

<i>There it is. Big damage!</i>

128
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:20,140
<i>Both damaged. To Pérez's front wing.</i>

129
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,960
[Pérez] What did Esteban do, guys?!

130
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,800
What happened today
is totally unacceptable for the team.

131
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,440
That's how not professional he is,

132
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,640
and, yeah,
I think I will go tell him the truth.

133
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,660
It didn't end well with Pérez.

134
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,640
It didn't end well with Alonso.

135
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,100
{\an8}[commentator 3] <i>The Alpines going for it.

[commentator 3]
<i>Not helping each other, are they?</i>

138
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,180
[Alonso] Sometimes it's very competitive
inside the team,

139
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,220
and on the positive side,
it's over, uh, finally.

140
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,640
[Ocon] I'm a competitor,
and I like to win.

141
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,240
[tense music plays]

142
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,280
[Ocon] Of course,
I've got a new teammate this year.

143
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,560
Pierre. Obviously, he's someone I know.

144
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,300
But I don't have my say
on these decisions.

145
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,540
[tense music continues]

146
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,960
[Gasly] Yeah, I know Esteban.

147
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,480
I know him like a younger brother.

148
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,400
The only thing is, with Esteban,

149
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,980
there are a lot of problems and tensions.

150
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,320
We both know we'll never be best friends.

151
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,780
[Gasly in French] How are you?
All good, thank you very much.

152
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,680
I was telling them
that we've known each other for 20 years.

153
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,760
Fuck, you're right. More than that.
We were six, seven?

154
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,580
I was six when I started. Six years old.

155
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:45,180
I told them that it's not often in life
you've known someone for that many years.

156
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:51,360
[in English] Ultimately, the decision to
put these two drivers together is Otmar's.

157
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,740
-Come on, boys.
-[man] Daddy is here.

158
00:08:55,780 --> 00:09:00,600
Giving Alpine the PR masterstroke
of an all-French lineup at a French team.

159
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,660
[laughter]

160
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,560
[Buxton] But Pierre and Esteban
don't necessarily always see eye to eye.

161
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,020
They have a history of not getting on.

162
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,580
-Great.
-Perfect.

163
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:14,160
Now we'll take the two of you
to the staircase.

164
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,180
[Szafnauer] I know about the animosity
between Pierre and Esteban,

165
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,280
but you don't need drivers to be friends,

166
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,160
and I can manage tricky drivers.

167
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,380
It's not easy to do.

168
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,860
It takes a certain leadership style.

169
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,620
But I'm confident in myself.

170
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,180
You want serious or smiling or...

171
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,280
[Szafnauer] A bit of both.

172
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,200
Same thing. I just smile now.

173
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,720
[Szafnauer] At Alpine,
there is a common goal.

174
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,140
We expect both drivers

175
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,260
to work together
to maximize the team's performance

176
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,300
in the Constructors Championship.

177
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,360
[tense music plays]

178
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,540
{\an8}I'm Laurent Rossi. I'm the CEO of Alpine.

179
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:02,000
Last year, we were in fourth.
Naturally, you wanna climb the ladder.

180
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,200
What we need is
to make as much progress as we can.

181
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,660
Progress that will take us to...

182
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:13,160
I hope, closer to the third position
or the podium, if you will.

183
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,120
Obviously, Otmar has
a lot of responsibility.

184
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:22,160
[Szafnauer] This year, there is definitely
more pressure from Alpine's leadership

185
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,900
throughout the organization to do better.

186
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,240
[tense music continues]

187
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,120
{\an8}[in French] Bruno Famin,
Executive Director of Alpine Racing.

188
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,220
I'm more of a person
who works in the shadows.

189
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:40,900
The spotlight, like this, is not my thing.

190
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:45,280
The pressure is, of course, on Otmar
because he is the team principal.

191
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,220
In 2023, there is Red Bull,

192
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:51,760
there is Ferrari,
there is, of course, Mercedes.

193
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,000
And our goal?

194
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,860
To be part
of those two, three, maybe four teams,

195
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,500
that fight for titles.

196
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,780
To develop the Alpine brand,
which is legendary in France,

197
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,300
around the world.

198
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,440
-[in English] Hello.

199

-[woman] What time do you call this?

200

201
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,140
[woman] Get your race suit on.
We'll see you on track. Thanks.

202
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,520
[Ocon in French] Hello. You all right?

203
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,620
I'm good, I'm good.

204
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,700
-I'm glad to see you.
-Yeah, it's been a few years.

205
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,280
[man] We prepared a great kart for you,
with your colors.

206
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,800
-[Ocon] Oh, really?
-Yes, we've gone to great efforts.

207
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,700
[Ocon] There's even the logo.
That's amazing!

208
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,800
[Otmar in English] The plan today
is to take Pierre and Esteban

209
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,240
back to their old days of karting.

210
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,160
We want to show the world
that they can work together

211
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,580
and put the past behind them.

212
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,220
[tense music plays]

213
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,200
[Gasly] The story with Esteban is, uh...

214
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,900
There could be a movie about it.

215
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:00,680
You know, we're both coming
from the same part of Normandy,

216
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,160
living 20 minutes from each other.

217
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,880
[reporter speaks in French]

218
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,480
[Gasly in English] Growing up,

219
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,620
from six years old until ten,

220
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,920
we used to spend so much time together.

221
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:17,820
We would practice together.
We would race together.

222
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,500
{\an8}And we were very close.

223
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,120
{\an8}[Ocon] Yeah, we were very close,
you know, friends when we were younger.

224
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,200
The first time he... he stepped in a go-kart
was in my go-kart.

225
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,700
{\an8}[reporter speaks French]

226
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,800
{\an8}[Gasly in English] My first year or two,

227
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,100
{\an8}Esteban was slightly better than me,

228
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:40,200
{\an8}and he would just, like, go behind me,
and try to overtake me,

229
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,660
{\an8}and play
these sort of psychological games.

230
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,100
And then after, I kicked his ass,
and he didn't like it. [laughs]

231
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,220
[reporter speaks French]

232
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:55,720
{\an8}[Gasly in English] I remember it was one
of the biggest national competitions

233
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,160
{\an8}of the year at that time.

234
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,140
I think it was 2008.

235
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,120
I had a fantastic race on that day.

236
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,360
And on the last lap,

237
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,040
I'm fourth, Esteban is third.

238
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,320
Both side by side, to the line.

239
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,520
And then, I just, like, pass him

240
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,240
just literally on the last corner.

241
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:25,160
The friendship we had,
it just went downwards from there.

242
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:30,180
[Ocon] It is true. That's what he did.
You know, overtake on the last lap.

243
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:35,140
But, um, I can tell you that he wasn't
racing the way he should have done.

244
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,580
[Gasly] Ultimately, I got disqualified.

245
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,200
[producer] Who's better at karting?

246
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,060
[chuckles] I have, uh, won more titles.

247
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,360

{\an8}[tense music plays]

249
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,840
{\an8}[Gasly] Um, I know
I've given Esteban many, many chances

250
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,840
{\an8}to make this relationship work,

251
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,840
{\an8}but if someone doesn't wanna be friends,
then that's fine to me.

252
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,020
{\an8}[producer] Your relationship
with Pierre, the disconnect,

253
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,860
are you able to expand at all on it?

254
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,880
Not really. I think it's...
There's a lot of personal reasons,

255
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,560
um, you know, for these things.

fighting against each other that hard,

came from the gravel.

00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,000
There was basically no room
for me to be on the right,

it is... it is quite, uh, quite obvious.

[whistles]

[reporter 4] Do you see it as equal blame

00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,020

It's a shame that they came together.

398
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,660
As far as trying to blame
one or the other,

399
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,620
I don't think
that's the right thing to do.

[reporter 4] Thank you.

401
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,540
[Szafnauer] The crash was unfortunate

402
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,560
because we lost good points
with two laps to go.

403
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,060
But look at the circumstances.

404
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,800
Standing start restart.

405
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,540

There's no finger pointing.

00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,000
Let's just solve problems

408
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,400
[tense music plays]

409
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,520
[Buxton] Let's make
one thing crystal clear.

410
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:25,360
I think a crash like this is a disaster.

411
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,840
It's an absolute disaster.

412
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,420
And Otmar's style of management
doesn't necessarily come up to scratch.

413
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:37,060
Otmar's gotta
pull his drivers back in line,

414
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,440
And who knows?

415
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,480
Maybe all they need
is their heads knocking together.

416
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,900
Because division within the team
can poison the garage

417
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,340
and rip it apart at the seams.

418
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,360
[tense music continues]

419

[Famin in French]
It's extremely frustrating,

420
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:55,500
but I'm counting on Otmar to double down.

421
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,620
He is the one
who is responsible for the team

422
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,180
and who leads the team into races.

423

[in English] One more on this

[Ocon] They decided to choose Pierre.

435
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,560
And in Formula 1,
you want to beat everyone.

436
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,980
You know, you need to be careful,

uh, with your teammate
once you are racing very close.

438

But, you know,
you want to score more points than him

00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,400
Well, I read it just like you did.

457
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,260
Um, so, uh, I...
I didn't have an idea beforehand.

458
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,160
Uh, he used words like "dilettantes"
and "amateurish"

459
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,840
to describe the team.

460
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,520
Well, you know, when we make mistakes
or when team members make mistakes,

461
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,260
we have to, uh, make sure we understand

462
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,740
the root cause of those mistakes.

463
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,960
Laurent did say
that the buck stops with you.

464
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,400
The team is your responsibility.

465
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,360
There was the inference within it that

466
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,040
your position
is under threat, effectively.

467
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,660
I've been doing this for 25 years
at a very senior level,

468
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:57,080
um, and, uh, know what it takes
to move a team from, say, last to fourth.

469
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,660
Um, so I... I have an understanding,

470
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,040
and, uh, you know, the plans are in place.

471
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,100
[Famin in French] So before Monaco,

472
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:10,760

[Szafnauer] Thank you.

518
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:51,360
For Esteban, plan A is try to undercut
as many cars as possible.

519
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,120
Um, we need to push
and try to get some points.

520
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,340
[Szafnauer] I can sense
the pressure to deliver,

521
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:04,280
but both our cars are in good,
point-scoring positions on the grid.

522
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:08,200
I think we got a good chance
of getting both of 'em on the podium.

-[woman] Weird seeing you in that gear.

527
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:27,160
[Gasly] I'm just such a fan
of Esteban Ocon!

528
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,240
Apparently, he got third today.

529
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:33,360
But they showed me a strategy for tomorrow

530
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,640
where I can...

531
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,020
where basically, I help Esteban win.

-[Ocon] Oh my God!

602
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,660
[laughs] Woo! Yes!

603
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,920
{\an8}[Loos] <i>That's the checkered flag and P7.</i>

604
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,940
[Gasly] What the fuck was that?

605
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,080
[Gasly] That decision to not give me
the right tires for the rain

606
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,320
{\an8}was a mistake.

607
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,800
It cost me the third place.

608
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:53,900
Pretty painful, because this would've been
my first podium with Alpine.

609
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:58,200
You know, as a team,
we still got one car on the podium.

610
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,420
But on my side,

611
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,360
I just felt like we gave it away,

612
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,960
and I just felt,

613
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,760
yeah, very... bitter.

614
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,620
I want a shower, so I'm gonna leave.

615
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:21,080
Did you speak to Pierre?

616
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,920
-I haven't. Not yet.
-He's around here, perhaps...

617
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,100
[Szafnauer] I'll go grab him.

618
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:28,560
He won't be in the best of moods.
We need to just go through that with him.

619
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:32,000
[in French] Will we see you
on the podium next time?

620
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,140
[Gasly] I don't know.

621
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:39,020
-[Rossi] You're holding it.
-[Ocon] No, no, it's you!

622
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,780
[Patrick in English] If drivers
put their rivalry with each other

623
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,580
in front of the success of the team...

624
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:50,040
[in French] That's pissing me off a bit.
We could have reached the podium.

625
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,760
[in English]...that animosity
creates a lot of negativity

626
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,920
and a crack
that can rise to the top level,

627
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,660
{\an8}creating a real breakdown within the team.

628
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:03,900
-[in French] I will dine with you tonight.
-That will be my pleasure.

629
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,600
-Well, bye. See you!
-See you soon.

630
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:15,300
[Gasly in English] Every weekend,
it's disappointment and frustration,

631
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:17,460
and I joined the team to

632
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,660
fight for podiums, to fight for...

633
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,480
Bring the team to the top,

634
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:26,040
be able to close the gap
to fight for wins at some point,

635
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:32,540
and, uh, since the start of the year,
I have been doing, like, two steps back.

636
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,800
I'm pissed off, but I'm just gonna show

637
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,020
that I'm the best driver in the team.

638
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,060
{\an8}Let's get on with it.

639
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,520
{\an8}-My contract is up for renewal.
-[man] Lewis, please come back.

640
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:50,380
[Hamilton] Car's slow, mate.
It's impossible to get close and pass.

641
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:53,100
When the car is terrible,
you can only do so much.

642
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,860
[Buxton] Will Lewis resign with Mercedes?

643
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,360
{\an8}[Szafnauer] We're underperforming.

644
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,800
{\an8}[Gasly] Something is not clicking.

645
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,700
-[Ocon] Otmar needs to find a solution.
-[Szafnauer] I sense the pressure.

646
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,420
[Elvis impersonator] Baby,
what's goin' on?

647
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:06,640
Las Vegas, baby!

648
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,600
[Leclerc] Oh fuck!

649
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,900
Fucking hell! What was that?

650
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,840
[closing theme music plays]

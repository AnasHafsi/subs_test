any reading, anything...

[Steiner] Yeah, I can read. Yeah.

Fantastic. That's always
a useful skill to have anyway.

I don't need any of this.

We had a few difficult years,

[Buxton] This year, Haas need no stress

65
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,820
to try and launch themselves
back into midfield contention.

I'm rookied out in the moment.

We need an experienced driver

[Hülkenberg] Where do you want me?

I thought, if we can replicate
what we did with Kevin,

00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,080
bring somebody out
which hasn't been racing for a few years...

{\an8}Nico Hülkenberg, MoneyGram Haas F1 team.

Guenther hired me
to bring experience to the team,

79
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,640
and the target and the mission is to bring
Haas further up the midfield again.

00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:27,200
Last year, we spent a lot of time
just chasing our own tail, fixing things,

81
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,240
and we couldn't think about development.

82
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,160
That is why I wanted
this combination of drivers,

83
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,500
you know, to help,
to make the team better.

84
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:39,440
We need to get a better platform to start,
that we are ready for better drivers.

is always to be successful.

He just doesn't want to be a backmarker.

126

He wants to be here to fight
and to get better every year.

127
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:45,440
{\an8}Watching your team finish last is
one of the most painful experiences

128
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,280
{\an8}in Formula 1.

129
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,980
Things can really quickly
spiral out of control,

130
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:58,140
and to try and get yourself
back out of that spiral is so difficult.

131
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,220
And in the last five years, the only teams
to finish last more than Haas

132
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,340
are my old team, Williams.

133
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,360
Uh, do you know when that goes off,
the red lights come on?

134
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,960
-Oh, yeah?
-[man] That stayed on.

135
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,240
Everything else tripped.

136
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,500
[Buxton] Over at Williams,
there's big investment.

137
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,220
They're gonna want to see
a move up the field.

138
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,960
And they've taken a massive gamble
with a new team principal.

139
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,980

from a place of team management.

00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,460
The world has changed slightly. I... I know
we have been suffering for a while.

156
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,640
But we have a car that if we get things
correct, we can deliver with.

157
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,360
And that's a very different situation
than what you had,

158
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,900
perhaps, the last few years.

159
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,160
Enjoy the challenge that's in front of us.

160
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,480
We're here to grow and expand

161
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,200
and basically become
better and better year on year.

162
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,800
I can promise you where we are today

163
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,880
is not where we're gonna be
in two to three years.

164
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,520
Haas are the closest rivals.

165
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,240
This year, they have
a tremendous wealth of experience.

166
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,340
I'm the youngest TP in Formula 1,
and I have a younger driver lineup.

167
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,520
Alex, do you want to add to that?

168
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,720
Yeah, maybe just, uh, more so that, um,
I do think we are in a good place.

169
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,340
We do, weirdly, have a car
that seems to go quite well around here.

170
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,440
It's all about the fine details,
and if we execute as planned,

171
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,820
I think we'll be in a good place.

172
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,440
[Vowles] Very good.

173
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,060
{\an8}You guys need to, like, make it
less depressing in these rooms.

174
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,160
It does feel like an electric chair.

175
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,560
Five years at the back of the grid
dents everyone's confidence.

176
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,160
As a driver, you know,
that motivation, that desire,

177
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,000
it just gets trampled on,
but that's why James is in.

178
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,260
[applause]

179
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,140
We've also got a rookie this year
in Logan Sargeant.

180
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,360
I'll be giving my everything
for everyone here

181
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,340
and, um, a lot to learn for myself.

182
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:32,060
I think, as a team,
we're moving in the right direction.

183
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,460
{\an8}My name's Logan Sargeant,

184
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,960
{\an8}Formula 1 driver for Williams Racing
in 2023.

185
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,860
And then am I meant to do that? Sorry.

186
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,240
All right, thanks, everyone.
Have a good race.

187
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,700
[man] He's like,
"What is your coffee order?"

188
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,060
[Vowles] A decaf,
but not this morning, actually.

189
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,140
-Can I have a tea with some honey?
-[woman] Tea?

190
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm really particular
on the caffeine input.

191
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,460
I don't put any caffeine in my body
until Sunday.

192
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,400
[man] Ah.

193
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,960
[Vowles] Because then you get
the real benefit of the caffeine.

194
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,560
The studies that go on about it,
after a period of time,

195
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,480
actually, what happens is you need
caffeine just to get to a normal state.

196
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,000
You don't get to an elevated state.
That's where you are.

197
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,520
The role of the TP, I think, has migrated.

198
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,320
I will be the first to admit,
I am pretty geeky.

199
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,380
Decaf still has caffeine in it.

200
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,240
-Oh really?
-Yeah.

201
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,280
It's just not 120 or 200 milligrams.

202
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,760
Data, for me,
is the foundation of Formula 1.

203
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,360
There's no human judgement involved.

204
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,840
You've got to get
your foundations right in data.

205
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,200
When you get that right,
that's how you move forward.

206
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,280
Quick look at timing.

207
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,240
Yeah, avocado.

208
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,800
-Yeah, no worries. Of course.
-Thank you very much.

209
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,160
James was a key part

210
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,240
of Mercedes' run of world championships.

211
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,360
[applause]

212
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,760
[Buxton] A brilliant engineer
who has learned

213
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,040
at the Toto Wolff School
of Team Management.

214
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,760
Hi. I'll have a cappuccino pumpernickel.

215
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,760
James, you know, do this.

216
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,880
You know, you need to learn this.
Like this.

217
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,400
Uh, apologies. There's...
There's a lot that I can...

218
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,800
[Toto] But you're getting there.
The shirt is proper.

219
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,080
{\an8}James is one
of the most intelligent people

220
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,680
{\an8}that I've worked with at Mercedes.

221
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,240
He was in charge of strategy.

222
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,740
In this sport, you need to get
the balance right between data

223
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:37,400
and then your instinct, um, as a leader.

224
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,040
The main part, nevertheless,

225
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,380
is running people that run racing cars.

226
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,800
And that is gonna be tough.

227
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,600
Remember what I told you
when I was at Williams in 2012.

228
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,640
When someone comes with energy
and ambition and determination,

229
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,460
you can turn around a team
that's even lacking infrastructure

230
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,200
by sheer, uh, energy.

231
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,960
[Buxton] You've got two different
methodologies going here

232
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,360
in this battle at the back.

233
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,420
Old school, new school.

234
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,060
Age and experience

235
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,840
up against a gamble on youth.

236
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,840
Traditional management versus
a new generation of team principal.

237
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,940
Today, we're doing two different crews,
so crew one and an alternate crew.

238
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,040
I am what I would call a micromanager.

239
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,400
Are you getting
enough feedback afterwards?

240
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,600
I can't remember the last time
I've screamed or shouted.

241
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,040
They need their fucking confidence.

242
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,620
-Yeah.
-[Steiner] I'm a pretty straight talker.

243
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:44,040
I do my way. If it works, fine.
If it doesn't, at least I'm responsible.

244
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,200
[Buxton] Guenther and James Vowles
are under pressure.

245
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,540
Neither one of them
can afford to finish last.

246
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,280
[tense music plays]

247
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,880
[Vowles] If we get ahead of them,
we're racing.

248
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,400
[tense music continues]

249
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,740
{\an8}[Slade] <i>Radio check, Kev.</i>

250
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,160
{\an8}Radio's good.

That car is lightning-fast.

291
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,240
Scoring points gives you the positivity,

292
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,800
the belief that you can score
in every race.

<i>as the remaining car of Sargeant
comes in a lowly 16th.</i>

297
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,940
[Buxton] Williams is struggling.

298
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,440
James has taken on what is inarguably

299
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,120
one of the most difficult jobs
in Formula 1.

300
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,920
You're taking a gamble on youth.

301
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,680
And if Williams don't start to improve,

302
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,320
will they ask the question of,
"Did we put our eggs in the wrong basket?"

303
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,160
That's an emotional roller coaster
I don't wanna go through again.

304
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,080
{\an8}[commentator 1] <i>And it's Alex Albon off.</i>

306
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,280

308
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,560
[Steiner] Very happy
to have Nico this year.

309
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,680
How can we make the biggest step forward?

310
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,120
Experienced drivers.
And Nico is one of them.

311
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,800
{\an8}I hit my front wing. I think it's off.

312
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,840
I'm so sorry.

313
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,180
[Vowles] It's fair to say
I've walked through the door

314
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,720
and I've seen what's in front of me,
and... it's worse than I expected.

you're looking at about 50,000 copies.

319
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,000
Yeah.

320
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,160
Prince Harry sold 400,000,

-[Steiner] Good lad.
-Yeah. Good on him.

322
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,400
-[Steiner] Yeah.
-Look at what he had to go through.

[man] Guenther! Guenther!

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,660
Can I get a picture? Guenther!

327
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,840
Oh my God, what are you doing in London?

328
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,320
-Good luck in the season, buddy.
-Thank you. Thank you. [chuckles]

329
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,080
-[Stuart] Making people happy.
-[Steiner] That's what I'm here for.

330
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,240
Hi, guys.

331
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,600
Oh my God!

332
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,160
[Steiner] You're welcome.

333
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,160
{\an8}-Hello.
-Hello.

334
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,600
[woman 1] Could you draw a tire?

335
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,340
And I'm gonna get it tattooed.

336
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,520
[Steiner] A tire?

337
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,180
[woman 1] If I see you at Silverstone,
I'll show you it.

338
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,520
[woman 2] A good start to the season,
so you're smiling.

339
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,240
[laughs] I'm still smiling.

340
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,760
You know, I'm still smiling,
so hopefully, I can keep the smile.

341
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,180
[Buxton] Guenther's star has never
shone brighter than it does right now.

342
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:10,960
At this point of the season, Haas are
sitting seventh in the world championship.

343
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,880
That's genuine midfield.

344
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,300
And he's a rock star.

345
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,280
[woman 3] Well done to Haas,

346
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,200
and you've got points already
in the Constructors, so keep it up.

347
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,920
Thank you very much. Thank you.

348
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,120
-[woman 4] Nice to meet you.
-[Steiner] Nice to meet you. Thanks.

349
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,280
The best morale booster
for a team is results.

350
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,600
There is nothing like it.

351
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,820
-Thank you very much. Thank you.
-You are welcome.

352
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:33,920
People thought our destiny is to be last.
We are not here to be last.

353
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,060
We are here to compete.

354
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,140
[man] Could you write,
"We look like fucking legends"?

355
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,020

"The Ferrari boys may be pretty,
but we have real men."

357
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,960
Oh!

358
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,120
Our story this year will be there is
no story. We are not looking for drama.

359
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,520
So please don't jinx us,
and keep away the drama.

360
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,040
Morning.

361
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,400
Morning.

362
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,200
Morning.

363
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,160
Morning.

364
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,560
Morning.

365
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,600
Morning.

366
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,280
Morning.

367
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,940
When your rivals around you
are moving forward and outscoring you,

368
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,460
it is painful. There's no doubt about it.

369
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,220
That's a good thing. It should be painful.
You should care about it.

370
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,880
If you want success,
it's all about the psychological approach

371
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,220
and the confidence
the driver has in that moment.

372
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:33,560
And my job in that is to create
the environments where they can grow.

373
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,600
[Albon] What is today?

374
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,600
[man] Power.
It's a little bit of contrast work.

375
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,080
Yeah.

376
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:48,700
[Albon] I'm not always the most outright
confident person that you will see.

377
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:53,920
We've just come off a dead run of races
where we've been falling back.

378
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:59,200
We're not anywhere close
to... to fighting for points.

379
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,580
[Harding] Three, two, one.

380
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:09,840
Has James articulated how much
of a bigger job it is than he expected?

381
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:13,600
[Albon] Yes. I think there's, like,
short-term things he can do.

382
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,680
We don't want to be fighting Haas
in the future.

383
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,880
That's also not where I want to be.

384
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,000
Teams are pulling away from us.

385
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,620
James has gotta try to make this work.

386
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,160
-Hi, Mr. Vowles. All right?
-Yeah, very, very good.

387
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,080
I never asked you what,
in your mind, success looks like.

388
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,120
Right now, in this team,

389
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,160
it's progress. It's seeing progress.

390
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,960
The reason why I joined here
was 'cause I really do believe

391
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,640
we can be back at the front.

392
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,980
-Yeah.
-Competing for winning championships...

393
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,080
[chuckles]

394
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,760
[Vowles] You joke and laugh about it,
but it's important to realize

395
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,200
that's the quality and caliber
that you have available to you.

396
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,080
Hm, okay.

397
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,640
You need to be turning up with a car
that's being updated several times a year.

398
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,000
-Yeah, sure.
-[Vowles] And it will keep getting better.

399
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,620
Prior to this, I think
there was a lot of resistance to change.

400
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:01,200
It needs to be completely
break everything again

401
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,860
and make sure we keep moving up.

402
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,600
Because of the data I've gone through,

403
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,080
we have made a number of changes
which I can't wait to see.

404
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,140
So I think that's gonna raise the bar
and improve performance.

405
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,500
This weekend,
you'll get a much better race car.

406
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,280
It's down to me now to make sure
that I prove myself to the world

407
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,420
that I'm capable
and can take this team forward.

408
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:32,280
[commentator 3] <i>Good afternoon

Um, just the... Just the normal thing.
Avocado and some... A smoothie.

412
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,720
-So not the açai today.
-Yeah, sure. No problem.

413
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,000
Although, we will try that...
maybe tomorrow.

414
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,040
[man 1] Tomorrow?

415
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:53,900
I just feel the risk of getting
this white shirt exposed is fairly high.

416
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,020
-[man 1] Right. No problem.
-[Vowles] Thanks, Harry.

417
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,580
I ate a lot of Chipotle yesterday.

418
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,160
[man 2] Did you? How's your tummy?

419
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,640
-[man 3] Best boss ever.
-[man 4] Absolutely.

420
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,200
Oh, he's over there. Look.

421
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,160
Ah.

422
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,060
-[laughs]
-Fancy seeing you here.

423
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,920
Big changes.

424
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,400
Hopefully they work.

425
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,400
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

426
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,920
[electronic music plays]

427
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,460
-[man] Are you gonna win this today?
-I hope so. That's the plan.

428
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:34,100
[commentator 2] <i>It's a great opportunity
for points for the Haas team</i>

429

<i>as Hülkenberg starts fifth on the grid.</i>

430
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,560
-How the fuck did you do that?
-[Steiner] What?

431
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,660
Yesterday. Very good.

432
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,980
Anyway, never mind. You're in
a good position until you fuck it up.

433
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:43,880
Fuck off.

434
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,440
-Every time I...
-Fuck off!

435
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,480
[Buxton] This could be
a huge race for Haas

436
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:56,280
because they start it with
a legitimate chance of scoring big points.

437
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,320
If Haas make the most of their advantage,

438
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,140
they will tighten their grip
on that midfield placing.

439
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:04,160
[Vowles] This is the part of the race
where you're like an expectant father.

440
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,360
You know what's gonna happen,

441
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,260
but there's not a lot
you can do to control it.

442
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:13,400
[Buxton] Williams are stuck, tethered
to the bottom of the championship table.

443
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,960
James Vowles is still trying
to establish himself,

444
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,560
but the more you let go
through your fingers,

445
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,160
the fewer opportunities remain.

446

{\an8}[engineer] <i>Okay, Logan. Radio check.</i>

00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,160
{\an8}[Gannon] <i>And radio check.</i>

449
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,260
{\an8}Yep, radio good.

450
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,740
The law of driving and racing
doesn't change.

451
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:43,880
{\an8}I know it inside out

00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,440
We need to make a step forward.

603
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,400
I'm not an engineer by trade.
I'm not gonna do that myself.

604
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,100
I mean, I've got people doing it.

605
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,100
We need to do something different here.

606
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:58,080
We need to make gains, and then
keep on making gains over the season.

607
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,640
In Formula 1,
times change very, very quickly.

608
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:13,020
So today's team principal is having
to deal with big data, big tech,

609
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:17,580
and have a true depth of understanding
and knowledge of these cars

610
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:20,040
and what's going on underneath the hoods.

611
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,480
[engine revs]

612
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,660
[Albon] I'm getting
quite big balance shifts

613
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,840
depending on which corner
I'm going through.

614
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,080
Yeah. Potentially,
this might change things.

615
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,520
So it's... it's not A, B, C, A.

616
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,220
It's B, C, A.

617
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,620
[Vowles] My background is in mathematics,
physics, the science-type subjects.

618
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:59,040
And I went into, uh,
an engineering degree,

619
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:03,200
and those really created the foundations
behind my passion for this sport.

620
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,720
Data drives what you're trying to do.

621
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:15,120
You're just running a million simulations,
trying to predict what's gonna happen.

622
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,600
It helps us because I'm very much
always trying to think ahead

623
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,840
to how I can get an edge.

[Steiner] It's a fucking embarrassment.
I'm fucking done with this shit, you know.

636
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,280
Something is wrong here.
Something needs to change on this car.

637
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,460
We cannot keep on trying to do this
if then nothing comes out.

638
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,200
Still need to phone Gene.

639
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:16,640
Fucking hell. That will be
fucking something that I hate to hear now.

640
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,320
Hi, Gene.

641
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,180
We look like fucking idiots out there.

642
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:28,120
I'm badly... I'm badly embarrassed, yeah.
I'm... I'm fucking...

643
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,520
I'm... I'm not proud of myself
here, you know.

644
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,420
There's something inherently wrong
with this fucking car, Gene.

645
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,660
Look, they couldn't get past
a fucking Williams, Gene.

646

[melancholy music plays]

647
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:51,420
[Steiner] It is getting tougher
and tougher in F1. Everything has changed.

648
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,400
If you know that you are last every year,
it's no point to do it.

649
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,200
It's too hard work for no joy.

650

[in Tyrolean] If only the season
were as good as the wine. [laughs]

-That'd be great.
-[woman] True, but at the moment...

652
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,160
Yes, we struggle at the moment,
in plain language.

653
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,640
Everyone made progress,
and we have problems.

654
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,900
{\an8}You have to find a solution.
It's not about giving up,

655
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,220
{\an8}but searching for something.
There are many minds involved.

656
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,160
[Guenther in English] We have
the last races of the season.

657
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,040
We have to get some points.

658
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:34,400
We have to prove that we can do better
than Williams at the back of the field.

<i>This is Mexico City.</i>

661
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,160
[Buxton] Coming into these last few races,

662
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:01,760
Haas have to have changed direction
or at least fixed the base problem.

663
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,060
[man] Yay, the new car is here.

664
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,400
[Buxton] The entirety of Haas's season
rests on this upgrade.

665
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,400
We need more performance to battle.

666
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,580
-[reporter 1] The guys've done a good job.
-Good.

667
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,240
-[reporter 2] It's a pretty big upgrade.
-[Magnussen] A lot of changes.

668
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,920
It's a very different-looking car,

669
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,620
but it's exciting
because, on paper, it looks very good.

670
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,700
[Steiner] The Constructors Championship,
it's more than tight.

671
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:33,660
One lucky circumstance
can get you four or five points.

672
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,460
There is nothing in between us.

673
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:42,140
[Vowles] So your biggest concern
was just the weird drop?

674
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,560
Yeah, but it was just like...

675
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,660
It felt very odd to me.

676
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:49,720
The championship is down
to a matter of points.

677
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,760
The only thing you can do is do
the best result you can with your car

678
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,040
and get every single point
out of it you can.

679
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:58,640
When we look to the performance,
I think you were the fastest on the grid,

680
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,940
so don't... don't go too far away
from what we already know.

681
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,860
-That's the only thing I'd say.
-[Albon] Okay.

682
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,080
Thank you for checking.

683
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,800
I want to finish seventh
in this year's championship.

684
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,820
I wanna show the world
that we have stepped forward.

685
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,560
Haas have a complete change
of car philosophy,

686
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,300
and you don't know where that's gonna hit.

687
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,500
[Steiner] The car is the last opportunity
to score points

688
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,720
and keep up with our opposition.

How are you?

750
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,740
[Steiner] What's up?
What's up with you instead?

751
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,520
[Mattia] Look, really.

752
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,880
Try it. Eat.

753
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,360
Take off the skin.

754
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,360
[Steiner] I eat everything, unlike you.

755
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:42,400
So now, instead of going to the track,
you can come here every week?

756
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,880
Instead of the races.

757
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,920
Yes, I'm here every week now.

758
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:49,440
Before, I was traveling to the track.
Now I travel to the vineyard.

759
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:51,820
What's better,
coming here or going to the tracks?

760
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,840
You don't have to justify
if you finish last or second to last.

761
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:01,180
It's all about slowing down, Guenther.

762
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,540
-Okay, shall we go taste the wine?
-[Steiner] Shall we go?

763
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:16,440
Cheers. To you.

764
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:22,040
Obviously, everything has changed
for me this year.

765
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:23,620
How do you feel about it?

766
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:28,280
You can feel where it's time to...

767
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:34,240
You focus on what you'll be doing next.

768
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:40,840
Of course, you know, I think you don't
get to make all the choices in your life,

769
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:45,280
but if some choices are made,
you have to accept.

770
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,740
There's nothing to be scared of.

771
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:50,420
Finished.

772
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:56,620
[Guenther in English] This year,
it's been pretty tough.

773
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,720
I don't know
if I will I do this for another year.

774
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,600
Maybe you have to bite the bullet.

775
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,400
There is life outside of F1 as well.

776
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:13,540
Maybe it's time to do something different.

777
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:20,880
{\an8}We expect both drivers to work together.

778
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:22,660
[commentator 1] <i>Contact!</i>

779
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:23,880
[Ocon] Oh my God.

780
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,240
[groaning]

781
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,180
We both know we'll never be best friends.

782
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:29,140
[Buxton] Otmar's gotta
pull his drivers in line.

783
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:33,080
Division within the team
can rip it apart at the seams.

784
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,540
{\an8}Let's get on with it.
My contract is up for renewal.

785
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:37,220
[man] Lewis, please come back.

786
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:40,800
[commentator 1] <i>The worst thing Ferrari
could do is start racing each other.</i>

787

[commentator 1] <i>Oh,
and Charles Leclerc locks up!</i>

788
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:44,660
[Sainz] Fuck.

789
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:47,580
Surgery is really
the only way we can fix this.

790

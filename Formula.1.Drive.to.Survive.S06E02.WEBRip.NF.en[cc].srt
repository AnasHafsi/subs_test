1
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,740
All right, Father Christmas, one minute
and then I'll get you to ring the bell.

2
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,900
-[Father Christmas] Yes.
-And then we'll get them in.

3
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,280
-Get them in, brilliant.
-[Horner] Very good. Excellent.

4
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,480
Guys, listen.

5
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,080
-[bell rings]
-[Monty] Oh my God!

6
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,840
[Horner] He's here! Quick, quick!

7
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,140
[bell rings]

8
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,940
-Wow, here he is!
-[Horner] Oh!

9
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,800
Hello there, Monty.

10
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,160
[Geri] Lovely.
Just go and say hello. Come on.

11
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,180
-Hi, Father Christmas.
-Lovely to see you.

12
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,140
-[Geri] How are you doing?
-I'm very good.

13
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,120
We're very excited to see you.

14
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,560
-I hope you don't mind me dropping in.
-[Geri] No, it's really fine.

15
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,280
Can I ask, has Dad been good this year?

16
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,340
[Olivia] Let me think about that.
Let me think.

17
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,880
What do you mean, "Let me think"?

18
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,520
-He won a championship.
-He won a championship.

19
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,720
-I think you've been amazing.
-He's superfast.

20
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,000
You know, apart from me, this man's
the fastest person in the universe.

21
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,340
I think Max Verstappen
might be quicker than you.

22
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,840
[Father Christmas] I travel three times
the speed of light. How fast does he go?

23
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,740
Probably four.

24
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,780
[upbeat music plays]

25
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,220
Right, these steps here, bit icy.

26
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,260
Okay?

27
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:30,500
We are alive.

28
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,940
[music fades]

29
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,660
[Horner] Who do you think
this horse would be if it was a driver?

30
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,880
-[Olivia] I have no idea.
-[Monty giggles]

31
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,720
-[Horner] Who's your favorite driver?
-All of them.

32
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,380
-[Horner] All of them?
-In Red Bull.

33
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,180
-Who's first place in your heart?
-[Horner] Daniel Ricciardo.

34
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,940
[laughs]

35
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,780
Daniel was a product of our junior team.

36
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,040
He drove for us for five years.

37
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,220
[Rennie] <i>Daniel, you're doing
a really good job. Very impressive.</i>

38
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,220
[Horner] Seven grand prix victories.

39
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,800
<i>Un-fucking-believeable!</i>

40
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,160
Over 20 podiums.

41
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,000
<i>Daniel Ricciardo, you are our hero.</i>

42
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,340
All achieved in Red Bull racing cars.

43
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,400
Then he left.

44
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,040
I felt disappointed
about him walking away from the team.

45
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,920
He went to Renault.

46
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,440
[commentator 1] <i>And Daniel Ricciardo
losing his front wing going into turn one!</i>

47
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,440
No!

48
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,440
[Horner] That didn't work at all for him.

49
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,900
And then moved to McLaren.

50
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,320
And that was disastrous.

51
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,600
[Stallard] <i>Okay, Daniel, that's not
the race we wanted, to be honest.</i>

52
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,260
[Ricciardo groans]

53
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,800
All sport is... is a confidence business.

54
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,540
You could just see
the confidence sapped out of him.

55
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,860
[reporter] <i>Formula 1 star Daniel Ricciardo
has been axed by McLaren.</i>

56
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,340
{\an8}I don't believe the Daniel we've seen over
the last couple years is the real Daniel.

57
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,720
{\an8}It's not the Daniel I can recognize
from his time at Red Bull.

58
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,680
-[Olivia] Daddy, go!
-Shh.

59
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,700
[Horner] As soon as McLaren let him go,

60
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,520
I picked up the phone to him,
and... and we just had a chat.

61
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,680
If the team in the background

62
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:17,180
aren't doing their bit,
the driver will never succeed.

63
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,500
[Geri] Yes, that's so true.

64
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,840
That's a lot of pressure, isn't it?

65
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,620
He just needs a good old hug,
and he'll be all right.

66
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,080
That's all.

67
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,840
[laughs]

68
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,680
I said, "Well, why don't you
come spend a year with us on the bench

69
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,740
and just find your love
for the sport again?"

70
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,500
[tense music plays]

71
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,760
Whether it'll help him
or lead to something, I'm not sure.

72
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:45,020
Ultimately, Daniel might have to accept
that his time in Formula 1 is done.

73
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,660
[wheel gun whirring]

74
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,700
[engine revs]

75
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,940
[upbeat music plays]

76
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,140
Where's the Statue of Liberty?

77
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,920
-Did we pass it?
-[man 1] Yeah.

78
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,000
[Horner] I missed it.

79
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,640
Okay.

80
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,520
Missed it.

81
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,560
[upbeat music continues]

82
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,160
[man 2] We are live here in New York.

83
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,260
Nobody pushes the limits
quite like Red Bull.

84
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,120
Now, we're gonna hang out
with a very special person.

85
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:32,820
And we're gonna welcome him back home
to the world of Red Bull Racing.

86
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,580
It's our boy,
and we're happy to have him back.

87
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,940
[interviewer] Nice kit by the way.

88
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:40,820
Thanks.

89
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,600
{\an8}What do they say, "Look good, feel good"?

90
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,040
{\an8}I feel good.

91
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,480
[upbeat music plays]

92
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,500
[Ricciardo] I'm back with the family
that it all began with,

93
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,100
so I'm really happy about that.

94
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,700
[Horner] Daniel Ricciardo
is our third driver.

95
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,780
He's gonna be working,
doing a lot of marketing stuff.

96
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,280
He's gonna be kissing a lot of babies,
shaking a lot of hands.

97
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,400
He's gonna be doing events.

98
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,420
He's gonna be, um,
you know, opening stores.

99
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,620
He's gonna be working
with all of our... all of our partners.

100
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,820
But not racing.

101
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,960
That'll be a lot of, uh,
let's say, my work and my contribution,

102
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,820
and I'll be working behind the scenes.

103
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,720
[Buxton] For as much
as it's a lovely story,

104
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:29,960
{\an8}going from full-time race driver
to a third driver is a fall from grace.

105
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,200
{\an8}It's a step down.

106
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,720
[man] Thank you all so much
for joining us today

107
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,340
for the Oracle Red Bull Racing
season launch.

108
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,820
[applause]

109
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,620
{\an8}Daniel Ricciardo goes from being
a race winner at Red Bull

110
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:46,140
{\an8}to many years later, now coming back
in essentially a marketing role,

111
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,480
which just must be
such a hard pill to swallow.

112
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,300
In my head, I'm just not done.

113
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:57,060
Um, I feel like
I've still got more to... more to give.

114
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,500
I just don't know
how I will get back to an F1 car,

115
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,040
but I know that that's something
I want again for sure.

116
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,720
What are you, 32?

117
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,600
[Pérez] Three.

118
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,120
Thirty-three. Oh, yeah, you're 1990.

119
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,840
You just turned 33? Yeah.

120
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,180
[Pérez] You are 33?

121
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,640
I'll be 34 this year.

122
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,640
[Horner] This year,
we're genuinely very lucky

123
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,100
to have some great, great talented drivers
at both of our race teams,

124
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,100
Red Bull Racing and AlphaTauri.

125
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,980
Good morning.

126
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,120
Ready to go.

127
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,140
Let's make up some time.
I think we're a little late. [chuckles]

128
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,000
{\an8}All right, I'm Nyck de Vries.

129
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,100
{\an8}I'll do it again.

130
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,960
I'm Nyck de Vries,
racing for Scuderia AlphaTauri.

131
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,480
{\an8}And it's my first year in Formula 1.

132
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,900
How... How far are we away?

133
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,820
-[driver] Fifteen minutes.
-Fifteen minutes away.

134
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,380
[Horner] Nyck is
a Formula E world champion.

135
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,140
A Formula 2 champion.
He's got a huge amount of experience.

136
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,560
[commentator 2] <i>Excellent stuff
from Nyck de Vries.</i>

137
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,140
[Buxton] Nyck's been rapid
in everything he's ever driven.

138
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,040
He's the Formula 2 champion.
He's a Formula E champion.

139
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,460
Kid's incredible.

140
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,900
But he's had to wait for this opportunity.

141
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,880
28 years old,
Nyck's finally got his shot in Formula 1

142
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,920
with Red Bull's junior team, AlphaTauri.

143
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,300
And he has to make it work.

144
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,960
[jaunty orchestral music plays]

145
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,980
-[man] Next one. Are we ready?
-[man 2] Ready?

146
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,760
-[man 3] Yeah.
-[man 4] That's right on.

147
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,820
[gunshot]

148
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,140
[jaunty orchestral music continues]

149
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,820
Just pull up there.
Go to there and pull up at the side.

150
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:08,480
[Horner] At Red Bull,
our philosophy is all about winning.

151
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,300
And any driver needs to demonstrate
that he's got that firmly in his mind.

152
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,200
You were driving your one.

153
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,440
Yeah, exactly. We've done the whole tour.

154
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,440
-Haircut?
-[Horner] Yeah. Tom Cruise, huh?

155
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,620
[laughs]

156
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:27,640
That winning mentality, I don't just
expect from our Red Bull Racing drivers,

157
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,160
but also our junior drivers at AlphaTauri,

158
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,460
Yuki Tsunoda

159
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,260
and the new guy, Nyck de Vries.

160
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,500
[man on video] <i>Get yourself ready.
Put the cartridge in the gun,</i>

161
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:43,880
<i>and think to yourself of the visualization
of the gun smoking a target.</i>

162
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,500
<i>The focus, hard focus, concentration,</i>

163
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,920
<i>and that rhythm and timing.</i>

164
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,060
[gunshots]

165
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:59,640
AlphaTauri's there to train
and develop talent for Red Bull Racing.

166
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,760
Well done, guys.

167
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,400
I look at those drivers

168
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,660
as are they candidates
for Red Bull Racing at any point in time?

169
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,560
[de Vries] Thank you.

170
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,800
If they're not,

171
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,840
then what's the point of them being there?

172
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,040
[man] Drive over.
Guns down and unload, please.

173
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,160
Well done, guys.

174
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,700
I taught 'em all they knew.

175
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,540
All they knew or all they know?

176
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,000
-[man] All they know.
-All they know.

177
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,860
I don't really have
any experience with guns, in all honesty.

178
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,560
-I... I... I...
-It's just this.

179
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,040
I rather prefer harmony
than fights and aggression.

180
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,440
Nyck, he's got
a huge amount of experience.

181
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,520
One would expect him to...
to really take the lead at AlphaTauri.

182
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,660
[de Vries] That was mine.

183
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,980
[Horner] Also, he knows

184
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,760
eventually there could be
a chance for him at Red Bull.

185
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,580
[man] Um, could I please ask the drivers

186
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,880
to come down and join me?

187
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,860
[de Vries] Um, Christian, thank you
very much for hosting this great event

188
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,380
at your, uh, lovely house and estate.

189
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:11,180
I just want to wish you all a great event
and weekend, this, uh, this week,

190
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,360
and hopefully Red Bull
can continue its dominance,

191
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,340
and we can try and score some points.

192
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,120
[man] Thanks, Nyck. Very well said.

193
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:21,480
[de Vries] I had to wait to be on the grid
for a very long time.

194
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,200
But I believe
I'll reach the pinnacle of our sport.

195
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,400
[laughter]

196
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,920
[upbeat music plays]

197
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,660
-[Horner] How you doing? All right?
-[Ricciardo] Good.

198
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:01,080
-A good friend of mine, Paul.
-Hi, Paul. Enjoy.

199
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,480
-[Horner] See you later.
-See ya.

200
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,440
[Horner] Yeah.

201
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,540
So he... he's... he's our reserve.

202
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:12,360
So he's taken a lot of the weight
off the shoulders of, uh, Max and Checo.

203
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,540
[man] In terms of PR?

204
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:17,800
Yeah. Tough for him, 'cause, obviously,
he's used to being sat in a car.

205
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,280
But he's making the best of it.

206
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,600
[woman 1] You'll do the meet and greet
first and then go on stage.

207
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,940
[woman 2] Please put your hands together,
and give a huge round of applause

208
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,400
to Daniel Ricciardo.

209
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,540
[applause]

210
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,320
Very exciting to see you here.
It's great to see you back in blue.

211
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,240
[Ricciardo] Thanks.

212
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,280
Can you tell us
a little bit about your role?

213
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,540
Yep. Um, I'm preparing
all of Max and Checo's meals.

214
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,740
[laughter]

215
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:43,020
Um, what else? Yeah. [laughs]

216
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,900
-Fabulous. I know you're really busy, so...
-I'm not really.

217
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,280
It's gonna be strange for Daniel
to come back into the paddock

218
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,120
without a race seat.

219
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,460
He's there just to do interviews
and smile and be Daniel Ricciardo.

220
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,780
You know, put the mask on,
do the functions,

221
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,360
and keep the crowds happy.

222
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,800
[cheering]

223
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,240
I'm sure that stings.

224
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,760
[fan] Daniel! Daniel! Daniel! Daniel!

225
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,660
Going to races, there's certainly still,
like, that competitor in me.

226
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,300
That fire is still there, so it's tough.

227
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,540
I haven't forgot how to drive.

228
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,060
[interviewer] Where's the seat
gonna come from?

229
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,040
No idea. [laughs]

230
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,200
[man] So this will be the new experience.

231
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:37,080
{\an8}Um, it's... You know,
so it's great to be here. [chuckles]

232
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,580
I'm Peter Bayer,
CEO of Scuderia AlphaTauri.

233
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,740
[Buxton] This year,
there will be changes at AlphaTauri.

234
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,300
Yeah.

235
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,620
[indistinct chatter]

236
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,780
[Buxton] There's going to be
a new CEO coming in,

237
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,140
who's looking to make changes
to secure the team's future.

238
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,560
Good morning, everyone. Questions for him.

239
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,260
Ian Parkes, New York Times.
Why have you decided to join this team?

240
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,540
I'm coming to a team
which has extremely solid foundations.

241
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:13,920
As a CEO of a Formula 1 team,
I'm responsible to deliver results.

242
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:20,440
The expectation is really to score points
and to fight for a top midfield position.

243
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,180
[man] Um, worst-case scenario,
we, uh, abort the scrub,

244
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,900
and we go straight into the soft.

245
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:26,940
Okay.

246
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,540
There's only one reason
you race at AlphaTauri.

247
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,780
You race for AlphaTauri
because you want to race for Red Bull.

248
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:40,520
Knowing that that is a step away,
it puts a lot of pressure on you to...

249
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,560
To number one, beat your teammate.

250
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,100
[de Vries] Yuki is a...
a very quick driver, but...

251
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,540
How should I phrase this?

252
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:51,880
Um...

253
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,080
I am a little bit more experienced,

254
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,300
more mature,

255
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,120
and more complete.

256
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,460
{\an8}The achievements he did in the past

257
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,660
{\an8}is, uh, is really big,
so he's a good driver.

258
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:07,620
But anyway,

259
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,380
it won't be easy, but I'll beat him.

{\an8}I struggled a little bit.

304
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,780
{\an8}[Hamelin] <i>We know what to work on
for the next race.</i>

305
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:31,940
{\an8}[de Vries] Copy.

306
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,700
The potential was... was there.

307
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,660
Um, but, uh,
we just didn't quite get it together.

308
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,420
It is the way it is,
and, uh, we'll move on.

309
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,560
[de Vries] When you live in a small space,
it's important to keep it tidy

310
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,300
'cause otherwise
it feels very messy quickly.

311
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,600
This is my kitchen.

312
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,560
Wanna see what's in the fridge?

313
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,620
Actually, my diet is very boring.

314
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,160
Is this extreme<i>?</i>

315
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,680
It's more peaceful when it's tidy.

316
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,360
I love my Dyson.

317
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,820
I actually do. I love cleaning.

318
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,440
I've always enjoyed precision and order
because that's just always who I've been.

319
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:37,860
I do apply
that kind of mentality in my work,

320
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:42,440
and I think that is a... a strong asset
and a strength for me.

321
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,320
I think that will do.

322
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,880
I got into racing
at the age of five years old.

323
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:58,140
My father was involved in racing,

324
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:01,240
and he was really keen
to get me into the sport.

325
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:05,080
Racing, that has been basically my life,

326
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,800
and it's been a long and tough journey,

327
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,060
but all the stars kind of finally aligned

328
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:16,880
and all the waiting and all the hard work
you've put in, uh, kind of came together.

329
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,020
Yeah. [chuckles]

330
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,600

-Nah.

333
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,980
{\an8}-It's not for me. No.
-It's not my style.

334
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,300
{\an8}I mean, it's Dubai style.

335
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,640
{\an8}-It's flashy.
-Yeah.

336
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,680
[upbeat music continues]

337
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:45,140

Yeah.

341
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,300
Perfect. Let's go.

-[Pulcini] Good day to play.
-[de Vries] Very nice.

Mamma mia! Disaster.

344
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,740
[Pulcini] How are you
getting along with Yuki?

345
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,600
-Yuki is a very quick driver.
-Yeah.

346
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,900
[de Vries] And so far, he has beaten me.

347
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,560
Clearly, the start of the season
hasn't been what I've hoped to show.

348
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,880
We've had five races so far.

349
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,940
I've had a bit of a challenging start.

I made too many mistakes,

From the start of this season,
from race one,

361
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,280
we've seen Yuki Tsunoda
consistently beating Nyck de Vries.

362
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,140
The expectation was
it would be the other way around.

The car is a bit different,
and I'm struggling to deal with it.

We should not forget it's also
your first year in Formula 1, huh?

[reporter 2] It's been
a busy couple of weeks

391
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,040
in terms of speculation
about your future and everything.

392
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,220
What conversations have you had
with the team about

393
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,260
"Where am I at? What's my status?"

394
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:59,940
We didn't particularly speak very much
in the... in the last couple of weeks. Um...

395
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:05,480
And honestly,
that's really what I can say about it.

396
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,140
Is there something obvious you're doing
that Yuki's doing differently?

397
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:13,800
Or is it just inconsistency as you, uh,
as you get your head around things?

398
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:18,960
I acknowledge my mistakes,
and... and obviously I want to do better.

399
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,400
So, um, yeah, I'm...
I'm not someone who is quickly satisfied.

404
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:39,760
{\an8}You know, it's a tough business,
Formula 1. It's not for the fainthearted.

405
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,660
You have to face
all the criticism in the world.

406
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,440
[Wolff] If you're not performing,
you're being ejected from the system.

407
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,280
That's something
you need to always bear in mind.

408
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,320
It's no bullshit.

409
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,660
[Gasly] You know, as much as I know
how good of a driver he is,

410
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,520
{\an8}uh, Red Bull doesn't have time.

411
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,520
They... They got no patience,
they got no mercy, and,

412
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,440
good or bad,
that's just the way it works there.

413
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,840
[Albon] At Red Bull,
your seat is never safe.

414
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,020
There are so many drivers in that program.

415
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,240
{\an8}So as soon as you don't perform,
there's a replacement for you.

416
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,600
And that's where the pressure comes from.

417
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,460
There still seems to be
quite a bit of chatter around de Vries.

out of the woodwork in the paddock yet?

It's still very early though.

435

I certainly don't wanna make plans.

Yeah. Take your time.

00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:12,800
Are you out tonight?

441
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:17,140
Yeah, I'm on the 9:20 with fucking
half the Formula 1 paddock, I think, so...

442
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,340
-Quick exit.
-Yeah.

443
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,780

farting in front of me, I'll be fine.

454
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,160
But it was decent. It was decent.

455
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,820
[Pérez] If you finish,
you will finish in the points.

456
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:06,780
I think that's what we got to do.
We just go to execute our race.

457
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:10,240
Not try and create opportunities
or force opportunities.

458
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,580
Just let the others do the job for you.

459
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,680
And keep it clean.

460
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,680
It's not straightforward.

461
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,720
{\an8}At Red Bull, the pressure
is tremendously high,

462
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,460
uh, at all levels.

463
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,120
It doesn't matter if you are
a Red Bull driver or AlphaTauri.

464
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,820
And you don't quite appreciate
how bad it is

465
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,160
until you've gone a little bit through it.

466
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,700
-[woman] Good luck today. Both of you.
-Thank you. You too.

467
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,720
[Pérez] Thank you.

468
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,240
I try to watch you too. Good Luck.

469
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:46,320
[Pérez] It's a good opportunity for you.
Just make sure you finish.

470
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,340
[de Vries chuckles] Yeah.

471
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:51,200
[Pérez] You've got to deliver.
You've got to live up to expectations.

472
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:55,640
Not many can cope with... with that
sort of pressure in this environment.

473
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:00,520
[Horner] Nyck, he was expected
to go into that team

474
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,320
really to be the lead driver,

475
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,980
and Yuki is taking that role.

476
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,020
[team member laughs]

477
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,540
[Horner] You can see the pressure,
unfortunately, building on Nyck,

478
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:14,600
but he needs to demonstrate
that he's got the ability.

479
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,180
Just deliver. Just perform.

480
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,360
[tense music plays]

[helicopter whirring]

482
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,320
{\an8}[Buxton] For Nyck,
this could be a huge race.

483
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,020
{\an8}[Hamelin] <i>Ten seconds.</i>

484
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,720
{\an8}[Buxton] An opportunity to score points,

485
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:35,100
prove that he belongs in Formula 1.

486
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,900
He just needs to get into the top ten.

487

490
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:51,480
[de Vries] To be a Formula 1 driver,
you need to be able to switch yourself off

491
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,740
from all the noises and everything
that is happening around you.

for Nyck de Vries.</i>

535
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,580
[de Vries] Too much time to get into
the rhythm, wasn't attacking enough.

536
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:36,320
But, um, yeah, I should've just
done a better job initially to attack.

537
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:40,220
He's having difficulties
in adapting to the car

538
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,100
and to the Formula 1 reality.

539
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,260
He has to improve.
He needs to deliver points.

540
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,240
Nyck's seat is under threat.

[de Vries] Argh, fuck.

00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:27,220
He needs to remember
how it feels to be quick.

He needs to remember
how it feels to stand on the podium.

[Hamelin] <i>Okay, so that's P17.</i>

554
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,320
{\an8}[de Vries] Very difficult.

555
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:38,120
You always got to keep believing
and keep pushing.

556

It's not done till it's done.

{\an8}[Horner] Nyck,
he's a really nice young man.

559
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,220
And Formula 1 is a fairly simple business.

560

Everybody loves you if you're quick.

then you can be as nice as you like,

[de Vries] Mistake. Fuck.

567
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:29,300
[Horner] I think it's... it's clear that
Nyck's not quite hitting the mark, so...

568
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:32,560
We were hoping that,
because he knows the track here,

569
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:37,100
that would give him the confidence,
but he seems to struggle.

570
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:40,500
[Horner] Question, whether or not
we make the change or not.

571
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:43,540
I know it's harsh,
but I think he's had long enough.

572
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,180
[Bayer] Yeah. Yeah.

573
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,840
[Horner] Hey, Daniel, it's Christian.

574
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,640
Something I wanna put to you

575
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:55,280
that I think could be...
could be very interesting for you.

576
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,660
Yeah.

577
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,480
Well, you focus
on getting yourself sorted.

578
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,680
{\an8}What time are you on track from?

579
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,960
{\an8}-Is it 9:00? Track's open at 9:00?
-Track's 9:00 to 6:00.

580
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,180
Yeah.

581
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,840
[Horner] We got the opportunity
to put Daniel in a Red Bull car

582
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,640
for a few laps around Silverstone.

583
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:34,700
And that is gonna be the litmus test to...
where is Daniel?

584
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:38,240
How does he compare
to our current drivers?

585
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:43,600
[chuckles] How good's driving
after having eight months off?

586
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,480
I know.

587
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,080
I'm gonna be carried out today.

588
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,600
It's all right.

589
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:54,360
[Horner] Nyck's not really getting
the job done, so if the test goes well,

590
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,960
there could be a chance for Danny
in the AlphaTauri.

591
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,380
I think once I put the helmet on
and stuff, I'll be like...

592
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,080
Get a first lap under my belt.

593
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,300
-It'll be good.
-Yeah.

594
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,080
[Ricciardo] I know AlphaTauri
are not completely happy

595
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,360
with how things are currently going
in the team.

596
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,600
So if this test goes well,
I could be back in F1.

597
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,500
[Friend] Know what time
Christian arrives?

598
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,540
[Ricciardo] Probably first thing
in the morning.

[tense music plays]

[tense music continues]

602
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,580
As long as he delivers today,
I think in your environment,

603
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,140
new start, new beginning,

604
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,960
he's still part of the Red Bull family.

605
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:47,180
He's gonna see that as an opportunity
to get back into Red Bull Racing.

606
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,420
And he knows this is it.

607
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,540
-This is make-or-break for him.
-[Bayer] Yeah.

608
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:53,680
[Friend] Let's go, mate.

609
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,120
[Ricciardo] With the test I'm doing,
there's so many unknowns

610
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,260
and, of course, some fears or doubts.

611
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:06,480
I haven't been in the car yet.
I've driven the sim many times.

612
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,520
Uh, which is
a great simulator and whatever. [chuckles]

613
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,800
But it's...
I haven't driven the real car yet.

614
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:34,620
-G'day.
-How are you?

615
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,900
-They... They fit still, huh?
-Yeah.

616
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,020
-I know.
-It suits you.

617
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,100
-A little... A little tight.
-[Bayer] How are you, mate?

618
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,480
-[Ricciardo chuckles]
-Yeah.

619
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,240
-[Ricciardo] A bit impatient.
-Like going back in time.

620
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,620
-[Ricciardo] I know.
-[chuckles]

621
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:48,460
[Horner] Looking at your smile,
it doesn't look like you're done yet.

622
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,780
-[Ricciardo] All right, I'll see ya later.
-Suits you.

623
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,560
[Ricciardo] I love racing, and it's all
I've really ever done and all I've known.

624
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,620
I think this is really pretty much
my last chance to be back on the grid.

625
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,700
I want this seat.

626
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,540
[Rennie] <i>Okay, so we won't do any
procedures. We'll just go straight out.</i>

627
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,800
-[Ricciardo] <i>Yep.</i>
-[Rennie] <i>Let you have a feel for it.</i>

628
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,440
<i>Okay, so it'll be straight out.</i>

629
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,140
<i>And track is clear. Track is clear.</i>

630
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:35,280
[Horner] Daniel knows everybody's
gonna be looking at that data.

631
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,700
Everybody in the factory,
everybody trackside,

632
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:40,980
is gonna be looking at that data
to say, "Where is Daniel Ricciardo?"

633
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,520
[Rennie] <i>Okay, Daniel.
Comments, please.</i>

634
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,860
[Ricciardo] It's not perfect conditions.
There are still some damp spots.

635
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,800
[brakes screech]

636
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,500
[Rennie] <i>Everything okay, Daniel?</i>

637
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:01,920
<i>Daniel?</i>

638
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,320
[tense music plays]

639
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,180
[Ricciardo] All good. Just a little spin.

640
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,560
[Rennie] Okay.

641
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,840
[Ricciardo] <i>After everything
that's happened,</i>

642
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,580
<i>I know I have a point to prove.</i>

643
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,460
-[Horner] Is that 28.4?
-[Rennie] That's a lap, yeah, so...

644
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,360
So he's on it.

645
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,220
[tense music plays]

646
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,320
[music fades]

647
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,740
[Horner] Are you and your, uh, cohort...

648
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:44,920
-Available?
-Available.

649
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,620
-Yeah.
-[Horner] Let's have a cup of tea.

650
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,380
Okay, so, um, that lap he just did, um,

651
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:00,840
would've put him next to Max on...
on the grid.

652
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,760
He's... He's...

653
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:07,240
Looks like he's the Daniel
that we recognize

654
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,360
rather than the one I've seen
the last couple of years.

655
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,440
Interesting to see what Peter says
from AlphaTauri's point of view.

656
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,420
We'd like to see him in the car
from the next race.

657
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,720
I think, Peter, you're in agreement with...

658
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,040
But then, after eight months
not being in a car,

659
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,840
is, uh, is quite impressive.

660
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,660
And, you know, as we discussed earlier,
for us, is... is, uh, you know...

661
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:27,740
It's not only, you know,
that it's a fast driver.

662
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:30,500
It's also that, I think,
we can learn a lot from him.

663
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,920
-Peter.
-[Horner] There you go.

664
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,060
-[man] I'm very excited.
-[Friend] Thanks, mate.

665
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,520
[Horner] Everybody's aligned,
so as long as you're up for it...

666
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,100
-[Ricciardo] Cool.
-You happy with that?

667
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:46,540
You got the mojo back. Yeah. Good.

668
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:47,940
All right.

669
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,880
-[Ricciardo] Thanks.
-Back on the team. Well done.

670
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,220
[Ricciardo] Thank you.

671
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,460
Just don't fucking crash it.

672
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,600
[Ricciardo laughs]

673
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,960
[rock music plays]

674
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:04,880
[Ricciardo] A year ago, I wasn't sure
if I would race again in F1 or not.

675
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,480
It's exciting. I'm really happy.

676
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:11,320
Just give me the car,
and I'll show you on track.

677
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,180
[rock music continues]

678
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,340
[music fades]

679
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:38,100
It... It hurts
that something you've dreamed of

680
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:42,000
and worked towards for so long,
that it ends, uh, prematurely.

681
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,460
I was aware I wasn't where I wanted to be,

682
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:50,480
but, um, yeah, I guess
such a call always comes, somehow,

683
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,520
by, yeah, by a little bit of a surprise.

684
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,100
{\an8}-[Norris] What's wrong with my car?
-[Joseph] <i>Box now.</i>

685
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,500
It's garbage.

686
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:11,300
It's rare one driver sticks
with the same team their whole career.

687
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,280
Hearing a lot of rumors around Lando.

688
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:16,480
Lando, you know,
we'd certainly be interested in him.

689
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,600
{\an8}The most excited people
when Danny Ric came back was Netflix.

690
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,200
I literally think they had to change
their pants three times.

691
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,800
-[Hamelin] <i>Watch out, turn 10.</i>
-[Ricciardo] Fuck! My hand.

692
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:30,180
We expect both drivers to work together.

693

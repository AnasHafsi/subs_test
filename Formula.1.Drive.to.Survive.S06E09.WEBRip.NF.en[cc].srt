00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,800
[laughs]

2
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:09,780
{\an8}All right, what's up?

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,480
{\an8}Daniel Ricciardo.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,480
{\an8}This is season six,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,060
<i>Drive to Survive,</i>

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,080
and yes, I'm back.

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,680
[rock music plays]

8
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,680
-[Friend] You hungry?
-[Ricciardo] Uh, yes.

9
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,220
[Friend] A little breakfast bowl?

10
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,620
[Ricciardo] Uh, cheers, bro.

11
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,300
What's that? A babyccino?

12
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,640
[Friend] It's an oat latte.

13
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,940
No, sorry, where from?

14
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,700
Uh, where we went for brekkie yesterday.

15
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:43,580
Oh.

16
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,600
No wonder why
it tastes like balls. [chuckles]

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,180
{\an8}People think
we're pretty much a married couple.

18
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,620
If we were a married couple,

19
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,300
then I would wait for you to sit down.

20
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,600
But that's why...
That's how you know you're not.

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,640
Mm.

22
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,520
You'd be lucky to have me, bro.

23
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,420
Also, if we were married,
I wouldn't do this at the table.

24
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,220
I think what's crazy is,
like, start of the year,

25
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:11,860
when I was like, "I need this.
I just need time off. I need a break."

26
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,080
But now, I feel so ready.

27
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,880
-It's... it's crazy how that's switched.
-[Friend] The flip.

28
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,200
You needed the, like, awareness of,

29
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,340
"Okay, I actually really love
doing what I do,"

30
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,420
and you needed to step away
to realize that a little bit.

31
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,940
[Ricciardo] And we're back
where it all started,

32
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,260
which is kind of crazy. [chuckles]

33
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,380
Here we go.

34
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,080
-[Friend] Yeah.
-It feels good.

35
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,780
{\an8}[cheering]

36
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,240
{\an8}[Ricciardo] Coming back
to just have an opportunity again,

37
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,160
in a family that I've got
a lot of good memories with

38
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,960
and people that still believe I can do it,

39
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,280
it's definitely a pull on the heartstrings
a little bit. [laughs]

40
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,860
Obviously, after last year as well,
I feel like I've got nothing to lose.

41
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,060
But also, there's... a lot to gain.

42
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:59,760
This is my path back, hopefully,
to the front of the grid again.

43
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,520
{\an8}Daniel Ricciardo has not
come back to Formula 1

44
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,520
{\an8}to race an AlphaTauri.

45
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,420
He's back for one reason,
and one reason alone.

46
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:15,820
He wants to find himself in the seat
he knows he should never have left.

47
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,760
The full full-circle dream for me

48
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,020
is to... to get back at Red Bull Racing.

49
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,140
That would be, like, complete for me.

50
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,580
If I find a way to kick some arse,

51
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,840
it could put me back in a position
to take top seat in the sport.

52
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,660
The Honey Badger's back.

53
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,260
I need to remind these cats.

54
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,840
-[Friend] Ready to go.
-Hmm.

55
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,960
[engine revs]

56
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,800
[Sargeant] All I know is the most
excited people when Danny Ric came back

57
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,680
was Netflix.

58
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,180
I literally think they had to
change their pants three times.

59
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,380
I know the episode already.
Let... let me run it through. Ready?

60
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,140
Here we have Danny Ricciardo
watching on the sidelines.

61
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,720
"Yeah, it hurts to not be racing."

62
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,320
Then all of a sudden,
pans to Nyck de Vries.

63
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,260
Lock up. [imitates brakes screeching]
Off the track. Crash. Oh shit!

64
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,860
Boom. Fast-forward. Silverstone. Test.

65
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,540
-Daniel Ricciardo. Super quick.
-[laughs]

66
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,200
Danny looking at it like...
big smile on his face.

67
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,360
-"It is what it is. You know?"
-[man] "I never left."

68
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,280
"I never left. I'm back, baby.
Honey Badger. Don't give a shit."

on-track action after the summer break.</i>

[Gasly] My pass is inside, sorry.

73
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,280
Hey, kick him out. He doesn't have a pass.

74
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,020
[both laugh]

75
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,220
[Gasly] What are you gonna do?

Daniel!

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,580
Daniel, please, a photo!

81
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,660
-It's good to see you on track.
-[fan 2] So glad you're driving again.

82
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,180
-Quite a return.
-[fan 3] Good luck.

-[fan 6] Daniel, can I get your picture?

00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,900
-Welcome back.
-Thanks, mate.

86
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:06,840
Welcome back.

87
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,520
[Ricciardo] Feels right.

88
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,040
Feels good.

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,200
[man] Nice to see you back.

00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,360
Good, buddy. How are ya?

[woman in Italian] Ciao! Welcome.

All calm?

95
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,400
[woman] Very calm!

96
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,740
-[in English] You?
-Good, yeah.

97
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,160
-Driver rooms?
-[woman] Over there.

98
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,180
[man] They would like to know which helmet
you're gonna use for the weekend.

99
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,720
Maybe all of them,
but what would be the primary one?

100
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,540
-[Ricciardo] That's good.
-[man] Okay.

101
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,660
They're gonna take some pictures.

102
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,300
{\an8}Daniel's got a huge amount to prove.

103
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,420
{\an8}Probably to himself
as much as anybody else.

104
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,920
[Daniel clears throat]

105
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,600
[photographer] The first one
we're gonna do, you're gonna walk in...

106
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,340
Esteban looks vicious!

107
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,240
I know, right? He's a man on a mission.

108
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,660
-Okay, so there's no audio?
-[photographer] Yeah.

109
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,400
-So I could say things.
-[photographer] Yeah.

110
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,840
-What are you staring at, you little fuck?
-[photographer] But your lips will move.

111
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,040
Three, two, one, go.

112
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,740
-Now you do the fist bump with...
-[Ricciardo] Both?

113
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:11,520
He was one of the highest-regarded drivers
in Formula 1 three or four years ago.

114
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,600
[photographer] That's perfect.

115
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,280
It's really weird
when you're not actually celebrating.

116
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,260
And in 2023,
nobody wanted to give him a race seat.

117
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,420
[photographer] Be there at 90 degrees.
Then you're gonna look to the camera.

118
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,460
[Ricciardo] Yep.

119
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,840
There's still question marks

120
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,460
of what happened at McLaren
over the last couple of years.

121
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,440
So it's inevitable that there's gonna be
a lot of pressure on him.

122
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,920
[photographer] Three, two, one, go.

123
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,040
-Got it. Great.
-Nailed it!

124
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,260
[Horner] In Formula 1,
you're judged against your teammate.

125
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,120
We're following Daniel very closely.

126
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,500
He is a prospect for us for 2025
if he delivers.

127
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,060
And, uh, he knows that.

128
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,520
Yeah, mate. [chuckles]

129
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,500
[Horner] But his teammate
at AlphaTauri, Yuki Tsunoda,

130
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,520
also knows that,
and will be looking to make sure

131
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,740
that he's putting himself
at the forefront of our mind as well.

132
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,220
[funky music plays]

133
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,460
[Tsunoda] This is so good!

134
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,520
[Italiano] They're generous
with the syrup.

135
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,420
[Tsunoda] Ah.

136
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,640
Sticky fingers. That's risky business.

137
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,420
-It's so good.
-Is it good?

138
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,300
Oh yeah.

139
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,360
[Italiano] We've gone there every morning.
It's worth it.

140
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,800
Worth it. Definitely worth it!

141
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,500
-Ciao.
-[woman] Ciao!

142
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,380
[Tsunoda laughs]

143
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,380
-[woman] We're going upstairs.
-[Tsunoda] Okay.

144
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,300
-[reporter] Hi, Yuki-san.
-[Tsunoda] Hello.

145
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,740
Now you've got Daniel as a teammate.

146
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:43,220
He's already made clear
he wants to go back to Red Bull.

147
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:47,360
So, how are you viewing this dynamic now
between you and Daniel?

148
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,200
You both want a Red Bull seat
should it ever happen, so...

149
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,080
Well...

150
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,000
Either driver will be slower,

151
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,040
and the slower guy
won't make it to Red Bull.

152
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,120
That's easy, so...

153
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,440
The faster guy, anyway,
will have more chance to go to Red Bull.

154
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,000
So it's how it works in,
I guess, Formula 1.

155
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,020
And... yeah, um, that's it.

156
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,300
{\an8}Having Daniel as second driver
is a bit strange,

157
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,860
{\an8}but it's not just about the Red Bull seat.

158
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,060
What I want, um,

159
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,080
is to show my value as a driver.

160
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,340
Um, how good I am.

161
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:20,220
So I will just have to keep
delivering the results.

162
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,560
-Ciao.
-[man] How are you, Yuki?

163
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,680
<i>Bene. Tutto bene?</i>

164
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,240
[commentator 2] <i>We're in Zandvoort.
It's time for second practice.</i>

165
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,660
[man] White suits you better than orange.

166
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,200
-Thank you.
-[man laughs]

167
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,600
[Ricciardo] I'm really excited
to drive again.

168
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,520
I think that'll bring out a lot
of confidence and a lot of joy in me

169
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,380
and, hopefully, give me a chance
to show my true self.

170
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,720
To have Yuki as a teammate,

171
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,340
it's another challenge.

172
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,620
Curious to see how... how he performs.

173
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,320
[Tsunoda] Daniel and me,
it's quite different how we drive.

174
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,160
That's because he's the one
racing with similar conditions.

175
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,780
You wanna beat your teammate.

176
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,060
{\an8}-[Hamelin] <i>Work on the speed.</i>
-Okay, understood.

[tense music plays]

178
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,780
{\an8}-[Spini] <i>Okay, let's go.</i>
-Okay.

179
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,500
[tense music continues]

00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,520
{\an8}[Hamelin] <i>Position is good.</i>

181
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,620
{\an8}Okay. Understood.

182
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:34,760
[Hamelin] <i>Yuki aborted the previous lap.
He will be pushing. I'll keep you posted.</i>

183
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,160
[tense music continues]

184
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,160
{\an8}[Spini] <i>Very good job, Yuki.</i>

185
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,960
{\an8}[Tsunoda] Let's keep pushing.
Let's get this.

186
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,760
{\an8}[Hamelin] <i>Okay, Yuki found a bit of time
braking turn one.</i>

187
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,100
{\an8}Understood.

188
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,400
[Ricciardo] Yuki, I think he's fast.

189
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,540
I'm not saying he's gonna be easy
or anything, but I'm not worried.

190
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,660

191
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:08,380

00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,760
Fuck!

[Horner] Hey.

204
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,800
Okay, and he's in a lot of pain or...?

205
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,360
Oh shit.

206
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,540
[sirens wail]

207
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,660
[Horner] Oh shit.

00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,600
[clicks tongue] Yeah.

211
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,260
You know when you break a bone.

212
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,620
It's just a different pain.

213
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,020
You don't wanna believe it,

214
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:43,500
but... deep down, I knew, like,
"Yeah, this isn't... this isn't good."

215
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,960
Surgery is really the only way
we can fix this.

216
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:52,920
The first feeling is, minimum six weeks.
It's gonna be a while.

217
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,440
What does this now mean moving forward?

218
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,400
[sighs]

219
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,240
[Buxton] It's game over.

220
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,000
Game over.

221
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,220
There is no way
you come back from that injury quickly.

222
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,320
And there's no way that, once you do,

223
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,680
you are anywhere near the driver
that you could and should be

224
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,340
for the remainder of the season.

225
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,760
[reporter in Italian] Daniel Ricciardo
has already gone to Barcelona

226
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,040
to get surgery.

227
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,220
He must be undergoing surgery.

228
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,840
[Williams in English]
This is the nightmare scenario.

229
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,020
{\an8}When you have a driver
that injures himself

230
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,820
and you've quickly got to plug the gap,

231
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,060
you end up scrambling,

232
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,600
and it's a really difficult,
stressful position

233
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,140
that you'll find yourself in.

234
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,780
That's your driver.

235
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,380
What do you do?

236
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,860
Fuck! I was on a really good lap.

237
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,940
Damn it!

238
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,380
So I say...

239
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,740
{\an8}"Hi, I'm Liam Lawson."

240
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,700
{\an8}-[producer 1] Don't say, "Hi."
-Don't say, "Hi"?

241
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,400
{\an8}Okay. I'm Liam Lawson.

242
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,180
I've been part of the Red Bull
junior program for five years,

243
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:20,840
and, uh, this is my second year
as Red Bull and AlphaTauri reserve.

244
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,740
-[chuckles]
-[producer 2] Again. Hold it a bit higher.

245
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,140
Did I not click it right?

246
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,960
-I have to do the whole thing again?
-[producer 1] Yeah.

247
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,360
[Lawson] The point of the...
of the junior program is to, I guess,

248
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:41,240
shape drivers up to get into Formula 1
and work out whether they're good enough.

249
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:45,440
And for me,
it was the only way that I could race.

250
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,840
We didn't have the money to go and do F3
or anything like that.

251
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,000
So without them, I would have never,

252
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,400
um, never come close to Formula 1.

253
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:59,500
Most people, to be honest, are like,
"Where in Monaco are you living?"

254
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,400
It's like, "Well...

255
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,660
yeah, I don't."

256
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,020
You don't get paid anything in Formula 2.

257
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,960
So literally, until you crack F1,

258
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,060
that's the point where you actually
can start making money.

259
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,440
I knew I wanted to be a racing driver
from when I was very, very young,

260
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,920
and I... I was always interested in cars.

261
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,680
I mean, everything with an engine.
Like, it wasn't just cars.

262
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,540
It was bikes, it was tractors,
it was trucks. Everything.

263
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,860
Mate, let's get this lowered
'cause it is a little bit shocking how...

264
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,280
-[Lawson] Back's all right. Just front.
-Yeah.

265
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,480
{\an8}So you're probably gonna take,
like, a thumb out of it, basically. Yeah.

266
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,980
How many reserve drivers actually get used
now you've managed to step up and...

267
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,920
[Lawson] I just... I hope that I, you know...

268
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,640
I know it's the only, like, showing
I'm probably ever gonna get in F1

269
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,580
to show something.

270
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,620
I haven't spent much time in an F1 car.

271
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:55,360
So there's many things, starts, pit stops,
things like that, I've never done.

272
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,180
[Smith] Do you think that you'll be judged
against Yuki on how you perform?

273
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,140
[Lawson] For sure.

274
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:03,200
But, obviously,
I hope that there's some consideration

275
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,200
that he's been in the car
a couple of years.

276
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,900
-I don't know how it's gonna be.
-[Smith] No, there has to be.

277
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:10,580
Your big F1 shot.
All the family are gonna get to see it.

278
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,320
Gotta make the most of it.

279
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,460
[Smith] It'll be all the time soon.
Don't worry.

280
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,340
We'll see. I hope so.

281
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,260
-I believe. Don't worry. I know it will.
-Thanks, dude.

282
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,280
-It's just round the corner, dude, 100%.
-I hope so.

283
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,340
[upbeat music plays]

284
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,300
The quicker we can
get to the air conditioning, the better.

285
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,340
-[fan] This is for you!
-[Hamilton] Ah, thank you.

286
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,300
Can I get a photo?

287
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,400
[Tsunoda in Japanese] Shall I
autograph your cap? You drop it.

288
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,100
[fan] That'll be great.
Thank you. Just drop it?

289
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,200
[in English] Ever gonna be
this hot in New Zealand?

290
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,480
-Not this humid.
-Yeah.

291
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,200
-This hot, but just...
-Yeah.

292
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,720
Like, humidity is crazy.

293
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,420
-Oh, my parents are here already.
-Uh-huh.

294
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,020
Early birds.

295
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,940
-[Lawson] Thanks for coming.
-Nice to meet you.

296
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,180
[Lawson] This is my trainer.

297
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,820
How long have you been here?

298
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:14,100
We literally just walked in,
like, literally 30 seconds ago.

299
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,120
[Lawson] Yeah, it's super warm.
If you want...

300
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,600
[Dad] Your shirt's quite nice!

301
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,580
[Lawson] My parents have basically
sacrificed everything

302
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,920
for me to... to be a racing driver.

303
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,720
My dad's been with me since I was
six years old in go-karts, so, um...

304
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,360
It's a very big deal for me,

305
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,060
but I think it's just as big
for my dad and my family.

306
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,600
Stand in front of that to cool down.

307
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,600
[Mom] Man!

308
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,340
I've been in the pool
three times already today.

309
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,420
-In and out.
-[woman] Just feel free.

310
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:43,420
As a kid, my dad would always promise
he'd take me to Singapore.

311
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,520
We never went.

312
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,180
But I know it extremely well from... from,
uh, being a kid playing it on F1 games.

313
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,180
Obviously, it's very different
doing it in person,

314
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,640
so I'm feeling very, very nervous
to... to jump in.

315
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:58,600
[man] Yeah, I always think he starts on...
I'm, like, thinking they're late.

316
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,480
-Hello.
-[Verstappen] You all right?

317
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,260
All good.

318
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,840
[Alonso] When did you get here?

319
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,080
This morning. Hey, mate.

320
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,460
[Lawson] Hey. How you doing?

321
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,700
Not so bad. Yourself?

322
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,560
[Lawson] Good. It's nice in here.
It's hot outside.

323
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,340
-[Verstappen] Get ready for the race.
-I know.

324
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,280
[laughter]

325
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,520
It's gonna be warm.

326
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,400
It's a warm one.

327
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,320
You're gonna be praying for it to finish
since lap three.

328
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,320
[Patrick] You're not guaranteed
to be a Formula 1 driver

329
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,220
{\an8}just because you're a reserve driver
or just because you want to.

330
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,580
{\an8}A lot of people want to.

331
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,920
This could be his only opportunity

332
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,300
to really prove himself
in a Formula 1 car.

333
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,140
He's probably shitting himself.

334
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,360
[commentator 1] <i>Welcome to Marina Bay.</i>

-Yeah.

00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:54,060

you can jump in.

339
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,120
[Lawson] I feel really stressed.

340
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,980
Just sort of anxiety.

341
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,980
Because of the track, the situation,
I know it's gonna be extremely tough.

342
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,000
I know I'm probably gonna be
at the very back.

343
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,700
There's gonna be so much to learn

344
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,480
<i>before trying to put
the best possible lap into it.</i>

345
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,160
But it's something
that I've been asking for

346
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,260
for a long time.

347
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,200
So it's realizing
how important this is gonna be.

348
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,440
My future will be judged
on what I'm doing here.

349

[tense music plays]

350
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,820
The moment of truth.

351
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,700
[Bayer] There's 20 seats in Formula 1.

352
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,980
{\an8}Every racing driver is dreaming

[tense music continues]

357

[Buxton] It's very hard to impress

358
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,080
when you're in a car
that's the least competitive in the field.

359
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,800

even before the start of Qualifying,

409
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:08,140
that you were gonna be the fastest
of the four Red Bull drivers,

what would you have said?

[exhales] Uh...

412
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,760
I mean, I dunno, to be honest.

00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,620
Um, obviously, it's not what you expect.

Not even something,
to be honest, I really realized, um...

But, um, there's still
more potential there.

427
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,060
[Ricciardo] So in the end, it was
fifth metacarpal which I broke.

428
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,880
Spiral fracture.

429

Drivers will lose

458
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:48,640
somewhere between three
and four kilos of weight

459
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,480
over the course of the grand prix.

460
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,340
That's about three or four liters
of bodily fluid,

461
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:59,320
which affects not only,
uh, bodily function

462
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,920
but cognitive function.

463
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,920
It has 50% more corners

464
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,220
than most normal race circuits.

465
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:12,140
It's probably twice as hot
as most race circuits.

466
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,040
And being a street circuit,

467
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:18,180
and being funneled
within those concrete walls,

468
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,860
where the slightest mistake
puts you out of the race,

469
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:25,120
there probably isn't a greater challenge
on the Formula 1 calendar.

470
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,080
[tense music continues]

471
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:32,360
[in Italian] Okay. Let's go, guys.

472
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,940
[Bayer in English] You know,
being last in the championship,

473
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:39,320
the pressure on everyone is huge.

474
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,940
And... And for the team to lose Daniel,

475
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,280
an experienced driver,

476
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,740
was like cutting off a leg.

477
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,760
-Might be your day, man.
-Thank you.

478
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,260
-Go and get them. Go and get them.
-I will. Thank you.

479
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,260
[Bayer] The challenge
for a young driver is huge.

480
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,640
So we basically tell them
in the first place,

481
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,040
"Go out, enjoy the moment,

482
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,920
you know, and try to adapt
as quickly as you can."

483
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,480
Have a good race. Ciao.

484
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,200
But to win points,

485
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,300
uh, to climb the championship ladder,

486
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,620
you know, we need Liam to deliver.

487
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,960
[Lawson] You spend your whole career
trying to get into F1,

488
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,080
and it's that realization of,

489
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:20,060
all of that has prepared you
for this exact moment.

or having that contract
for a full-time seat,

There's a lot of things going on,
to be honest, so it's... it's, um... Yeah.

724
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:56,160
I think, uh, emotionally
and... and mentally,

725
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,140
pretty draining, yeah.

726
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:04,520
[Buxton] Formula 1,

727
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:08,180
it's never just about the stopwatch.

728
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,040
There's politics.

729
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,700
Big business.

730
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,160
Sponsorship. Popularity.

731
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,080
A myriad of considerations

732
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,560
for every seat.

733
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,780
He's a great young man, Liam, who...
you know, who has... has lots of talent,

734
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,980
but I believe nowadays in Formula 1,

735
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:30,140
you... you know, you need experience.

736
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:33,980
And so we believe that Daniel and Yuki,

737
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:38,100
with... with Liam as a reserve driver
for both teams,

738
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,880
uh, is the right choice.

739
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,460
-Daniel on the way.
-[Tsunoda] Yeah.

740
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:48,440
We will have consistency
and continuity with Yuki.

741
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,260
And Daniel's seen
how Liam's done in that car.

742
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,300
The expectation is
for him to carry that on.

743
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:57,480
But he's just got to refine
that form, that motivation,

744
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,920
uh, that he had.

745
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,400

and... and those, like, nerves.

with you, Daniel?

-Hola.

[Ricciardo] But I'm ready.

[fan 3] Ricciardo! I love you, Ricciardo.

Like, yeah, okay,
will I feel a little bit of pain?

768
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:13,420
Maybe, but nothing
that's gonna hinder my performance

769
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,600

AlphaTauri, plum last in the Championship.

773
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:47,020
An uncompetitive car.
Daniel has to giant-kill.

774
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,020
This is his one shot, now,
to score points.

775
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:53,940
Yes, Christian has a soft spot for him,
but that's not enough.

776
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,880
He has to show he's back to his best,

777
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,540
he's back to the driver
that they remember him being.

778
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,220
[Bayer] Our expectations
towards Daniel are high.

779
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,780
I'm very concerned

780
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,860
because currently, we are P10.

781
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:13,660
In the world-championship rankings,
we're last.

782
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:17,800
Racing in P10, for us,
simply is not an option.

783
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,700
Daniel will have to deliver points.

[Ricciardo] After everything
that's kinda happened,

some better results.

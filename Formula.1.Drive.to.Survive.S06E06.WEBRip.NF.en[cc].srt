00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,000
[engine revs]

00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,040
[tires screech]

3
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,480
{\an8}That's a bit more like it. This is fun.

4
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,360
[sighs] All right. That's fun over.

5
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,480
Was that any good or not?

6
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,700
-I'm dizzy!
-Oh no!

7
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,320
I think we should do
a donut challenge here.

8
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,380
[laughter]

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,900
[woman] Please, guys,
just so that we can put the one here.

10
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,940
-Hey, what's up, man? Good?
-You good?

11
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,000
But I think also that we have...
Ah, here. Lewis.

12
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,980
[man 1] I think, uh, the best
is to begin with choosing the keys.

13
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,580
-Yeah.
-[man 2] But we mic you up first...

14
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:55,620
Let's get on with it.

15
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,460
-[man 2] We mic you up first.
-Way too much doo-dallying.

16
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,200
-[woman] So, uh, yeah...
-Let's go.

17
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:04,180
[Hamilton] I've been with Mercedes
since I was 13,

18
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,220
so perspectives just shift.

19
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,640
{\an8}This year, my contract is up for renewal.

20
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,540
I left my house at five fricking 45
this morning.

21
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,980
Did you? Oh, my alarm
was at quarter past eight.

22
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,900
-[Hamilton] Quarter past eight?
-[laughs] Yeah.

23
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:23,260
What's this with timings?
He left at quarter past eight.

24
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,560
-That's why you get the big bucks.
-He's younger. He doesn't need to sleep.

25
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,600
-They can have it back. I want my sleep.
-Give it to me. I'll take it. [laughs]

26
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,760
Follow me if you like.

27
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,660
My mindset's really like,
"Okay, we've had two difficult years."

28
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,080
So my goal is to get back on the top.

29
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,300
I'm trying to win
a world championship again.

30
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,280
But...

31
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,880
then we get in the car in 2023
and it's the evil sister. [laughs]

32
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,880
Yeah.

33
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,140
[tense music plays]

34
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,480
[Hamilton] All right,
let's quickly do this part.

35
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,660
-[Russell] You getting fed up?
-[Hamilton] Yep.

36
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,320
[woman] Everyone ready?

37
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,440
[man 1] So I think the only thing missing
is the drift challenge, so...

38
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,920
Shall we just direct it ourselves?

39
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,900
[chuckling]

40
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,820
[Patrick] With everything
that Lewis has accomplished,

41
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:21,480
the one thing
that's stopping Lewis from being done

42
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,220
{\an8}is winning the eighth championship.

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
To be the best
that Formula 1 has ever seen,

44
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,220
with the most amount of championships
of any driver ever.

45
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,900
They're such eavesdroppers, Netflix.

46
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,380
[woman laughs]

47
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,420
You can be on the toilet,
you look over your head,

48
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:42,480
and there's a fucking boomstick.
You're like, "How did you get there?"

49
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,140
I've been on the toilet with a mic on,
and it was only after I flushed, I was...

50
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,800
-[Hamilton] A number two?
-[Russell] Yeah.

51
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,540
-[Hamilton laughs]
-[woman] Wanna tell us...

52
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,220
Really? [laughs]

53
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,780
-And he was there with the headphones.
-[laughs]

54
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,780
[Patrick] But to really turn a car around,
sometimes it can take years.

55
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,580
And of course, the... the clock...

56
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:04,960
Like he's, you know... He's getting older.
How many more seasons is he gonna have?

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,480
Camera's in position.

58
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,980
George, you start.

59
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,940
Lewis, you have to wait
until George comes back, okay?

60
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,680
I can't really remember winning
if I'm really honest.

61
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,360
Uh, it's been, like, a minute,
so I don't remember what that feeling is.

62
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,940
[man 1] Now, Lewis, stop. Just George.

63
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,480
[Hamilton] But it is what it is.
You just have to take it on the chin

64
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,060
and just acknowledge
that we did not get it right,

65
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,380
we took the wrong decisions,

66
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:32,300
and start really making big strides
in the right direction.

67
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,260
[woman] Lewis, wait!

68
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,240
[Hamilton] Before it's too late.

69
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,920
[engine roars]

70
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,880
[woman] Lewis!

71
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,420
[man 1] Lewis, please come back.

72
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,100
Lewis, can you get back in position?

73
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,260

[tense music plays]

88
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,260
[Hamilton] It's impossible
to get close and pass.

89
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,000
This car is slow, mate.

90
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,680
[Hamilton] When the car is terrible,
I feel helpless.

91
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,980
I can try and deliver each weekend,

92
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,720

with what you got.

[Hamilton] Shit.

105
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,660
{\an8}The Monaco result will be, uh,
a massive disappointment to Mercedes.

106
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,840
But it's really indicative
of where they're at

107
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,640
because P4 and P5
is actually their new reality.

[crowd cheering]

109
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,040
[Hamilton] Fernando,
he's really made a great decision.

110
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,920
On one side, this is really inspiring.

111
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,260
Um...

112
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,960
Yeah, and then on the flip side,
it's obviously... frustrating for sure.

113
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,000
[Williams] Lewis
will be watching Fernando

114
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,720
{\an8}and thinking, "Why is that not me?"

115
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:29,360
The Mercedes is not the best car,
so Lewis has a decision on his hands.

116
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,000
Does he stay?

117
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,500
Or does he leave Mercedes
and make that leap?

118
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,340
[cheering]

119
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,960
[Williams] Fernando Alonso
has pivoted a lot in his career.

120
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,940
He's always looked to travel to the team

121
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:47,360
who he thinks is going to give him
the fastest race car.

is on the podium for Aston Martin!</i>

123
00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:00,920
{\an8}I felt that it was necessary for my career
to gamble a little bit more.

124
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,540
[commentator 2] <i>Yet again,
Fernando Alonso on the podium.</i>

125
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,020
[Alonso] And to take some risk.

[commentator 1] <i>Fernando Alonso
will take another podium.</i>

127
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,600
[Alonso] I think this year,
with the results that we're having

128
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,660
and, uh, being competitive,

129
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,260
reaching podiums...

130
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,920
[announcer] <i>Alonso of Spain!</i>

131
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,180
...proves it was a good decision
to join Aston Martin.

132
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,300
[Russell] I don't know
if times are different now

133
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,580
compared to, let's say,
when you had the glory years,

134
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,920
but the braking is still a real limitation

135
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,760
with the car sort of bouncing at the rear.

136
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,380
[Wolff] George, I think
from our perspective...

137
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,360
Sorry. We have a bit of a delay.
From our perspective now,

138
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,680
obviously we are not in the car
and don't know how it feels,

139
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,320
but we can see that it's getting
two or three tenths less good

140
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,580
against the competition.

141
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,900
Nobody on the team is impressed
with the results so far.

142
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,060
{\an8}We have a car that's not
where we would like it to be,

143
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,380
and then obviously,
Lewis is not impressed.

144
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,180
The weakest part of our car
is the rear end.

145
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,460
That wing is...

146
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,880
It's really a barn door.
It's very, very draggy.

147
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,780
Um...

148
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,660
Last year was the same.
The year before that was the same.

149
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,260
Last year, I remember complaining
to the team

150
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,020
and being like,
"Look, we have to make these changes."

151
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,860
"Like, otherwise, this is
the trajectory we're gonna go on,

152
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,580
and this is where we're gonna end up,
and it's... it's..."

153
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,060
"Please do something about it."

154
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,280
And I remember that they said, like, um,

155
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,940
"We know what we're doing."

156
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,920
Um, "You're wrong."

157
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,240
And that was definitely
an interesting moment.

158
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,300
I mean, I just... I was like, "Okay."

159
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,200
I'll step back.
Don't wanna step on anybody's toes and...

160
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,060
And then, uh, yeah...

161
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,540
[chuckles] ...when we got into the season,

162
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,040
then we spoke again.

163
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,240
Like, "Oh, maybe you were right."
[chuckles]

164
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,040
So, um, yeah.

165
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,480
[Susie Wolff] Here we are, Jackie.
Are you excited to drive, Jack?

166
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,120
-You wanna go for it?
-Yeah.

167
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,940
I'm gonna crash you off the track.

168
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,340
You're gonna crash me off the track?

169
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,440
That's not very nice.

170
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,480
-[Wolff] You can't do that.
-No.

171
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,060
[Wolff] Anyway, we don't want
to be a racing driver.

172
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,120
That's only third option.

173
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,580
Uh, yeah, third option.

174
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,980
We want to save animals,
or be a Scottish rugby player.

175
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,340
Maybe I'm gonna do all three.

176
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,020
[Susie laughs] Okay.

177
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,860
The most important is you enjoy it,
and you have fun.

178
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,260
-[man 1] Ciao Jack!
-[Jack] Ciao.

179
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,880
-[Susie] Good morning.
-[man 1] Morning.

180
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,980
[woman] Good morning.

181
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,980
-[man 1] Toto, good morning.
-[Wolff] Good morning. Ciao.

182
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,020
[woman] Morning.

183
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,700
[man 2] Jack, your car is ready.

184
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:09,160
-[Jack] I'm gonna win. I'm gonna win.
-[Susie] You're gonna win?

185
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,920
[Susie chuckles] Look how small he looks.

186
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,540
[Wolff] I think he's gonna complain
it's too slow.

187
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,580
[Susie chuckles]

188
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:32,000
[Susie] I think Toto has
a certain amount of patience.

189
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,020
But when he sees
there's not being any progress made,

190
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:41,300
{\an8}that's where you can definitely see him
switch into a different mode.

191
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,000
-[Wolff in Italian] This is full.
-[man 1] Let's change the engine?

192
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,420
[Wolff] Yes, let's stop the car.

193
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,420
[in English] Put the bigger engine in.

194
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,820
[in Italian] Let's bring him in
to make changes.

195
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,740
[Susie in English] Racing's tough.
There's only ever one winner.

196
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,780
You gotta learn how to cope with losing.

197
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,460
[Wolff] You need to cope with pressure.
Look where we are this season.

198
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,400
You know, the expectations of everyone.

199
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,920
When is Mercedes gonna come back
after eight world championships?

200
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,060
[Jack] Why is my kart so slow?

201
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,840
But that's racing.
You can't win everything.

202
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,700
You can't win always.

203
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,360
It goes in cycles.

204
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,980
No, you can break cycles.
We're not in a cycle.

205
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:42,080
You've seen the Schumacher years,
then Vettel, then Mercedes,

206
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,800
and now it's two years in a row,
uh, Max, but...

207
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,340
you gotta break that.

208
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:55,180
The Mercedes team really started
to go from strength to strength in 2013.

209
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,100
It was the time when Lewis and I joined,

210
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,120
and we came from two different worlds.

211
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,700
My background was more finance,
and he's been, all his life, a superstar.

212
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,740
[announcer] <i>Let the celebrations begin!</i>

213
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:11,340
[Wolff] That year, we finished
second in the championship.

214
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,820
And from 2014 until 2021...

215
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,220
[Hamilton] Woo-hoo!

216
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,240
[Wolff] ...we won
eight Constructors Championships in a row.

217
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,220
[commentator 3]
World Championship record is equalled!

218
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,160
[Wolff] Seven Driver Championships.

219
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,800
[commentator 3] <i>Lewis Hamilton
is a seven-time champion of the world!</i>

220
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,000
[Wolff] Lewis beat the all-time record
of 100 race wins.

221
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,440
I can't believe that we're at 100.
I'm ecstatic, like it's my first.

222
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,580
[Wolff] These records
were very satisfying.

223
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,220
But Lewis is much more than my driver.

224
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,660
Lewis is a friend.

225
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,080
This is his family and his home.

226
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,120
And therefore, I wouldn't want
to have any other driver in the car.

227
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,120
[Susie] We have not discussed
if Lewis will re-sign.

228
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,020
It will either happen

229
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,260
because it's meant to happen,

230
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:07,560
or there will be a feeling
that the journey's come to an end.

231
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,140
[Wolff] Put your hand on my shoulder

232
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,080
like you have pity with me.

233
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,860
[both chuckle]

234
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:21,700
[Susie laughs]

235
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,960
[gentle music plays]

236
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,780
[man 1] Are you ready, Jack?

237
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,220
[Susie] Toto knows he's responsible,

238
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,000
so it's just having belief.

239
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:52,040
"Okay, we got it wrong, and we need
to get back on track and turn it around."

240
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,880
And he will.

241
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,360
[hopeful music plays]

242
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,300
Yeah, you see the acceleration.

243
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:12,360
[Wolff] For Lewis to win an eighth
championship and George to win his first,

244
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:16,640
we owe it to them to provide them
with a good car. That's the minimum.

245
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,000
[man 1] He's fast.

246
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,720
[Wolff] That's a big upgrade.

247
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,320
And if we're able to achieve that,

248
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,220
we will be
a championship-winning team again.

249
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,680
[Wolff laughs]

250
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,500
[phone rings]

251
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,580
[receptionist] Reception.

252
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,160
Yeah, I have given him the message.
I do apologize.

253
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,880
I think they're just really busy.

254
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,640
Okay, thank you. Bye. Bye.

255
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,680
A winning team
is a combination of several factors.

256
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,160
It is the right people, the right place,

257
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,080
the right mindset, the right values.

258
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,940
Our main problem
is just the lack of performance.

259
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:08,020
Obviously, there is drive
to make the car faster,

260
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,660
but we didn't change the concept,

261
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:15,340
so we have to live with what we have,
find out where it is we can optimize,

262
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,260
and try to make inroads.

263
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,060
So there is a bracket now
that is offset ten mil.

264
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,680
[Wolff] Our sport is a data-driven sport,

265
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,620
but data don't make decisions.

266
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,900
It's people that do.

267
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,280
[man] At the moment, that thing needs
a definite fuel-system swap.

268
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,120
[Wolff] With a single upgrade,

269
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:37,900
you can unlock the potential in a car
and suddenly fight for podiums.

270
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,280
[man] The little things
that find you half a tenth.

271
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,480
[Wolff] I don't expect this to be easy,

272
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,820
but I have ultimate faith in the team.

273
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,120
We just gotta give it everything
to get the season back on track.

274
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,740
[cheering]

275
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,780
[upbeat music plays]

276
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,980
[crowd cheers]

277
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,980
[Alonso] In Spain,
there is always this feeling

278
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:18,520
of it's once a year
that you have the home grand prix.

279
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:24,560
This year is the 20th anniversary
of my first win in Formula 1.

280
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,620
[fan] Fernando! Fernando! Fernando!

281
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,740
And 20 years later,
I'm still, uh, fighting for wins.

282
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,440
[upbeat music continues]

283
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,240
[Russell] Good morning.

284
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,660
[fan] George! George,
what do you think of beans on toast?

285
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,180
Beans on toast? I like it.

286
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,580
Pre-race prediction? Yeah, gonna win.

287
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:47,320
-[man] Pre-race prediction.
-Yeah, I'm gonna win. Yeah.

288
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,280
[reporter] And if it's not you?

289
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,200
Fernando.

290
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,720
I wanna see Fernando win a race.
Who doesn't?

291
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,100
[man] Thanks for joining.

292
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:07,320
Who would like to take the first question
for Lewis from the floor?

293
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,060
[reporter 1] I think Toto said
after the last race

294
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:14,660
that he doesn't expect to clear,
um, Aston Martin and Ferrari here,

295
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,860
so is that your feeling
and the general feeling of the team?

296
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,340
I... I really don't know what to expect.

297
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,200
I'm still hopeful that we can compete
with them this weekend,

298
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,740
but it's a big hope.

299
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,580
I just feel so incredibly hungry to win

300
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:34,680
and willing to sacrifice
pretty much everything, um,

301
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,440
in order to get...
to... to get to where I need to be.

302
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,640
[tense music plays]

303
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,120
[reporter 2] <i>Silly season hasn't begun,</i>

304
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,360
<i>there's already a lot of noise

305
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,180
<i>and a possible move to Ferrari.</i>

306
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,820
[reporter 2] <i>Thinking about Lewis
in a red suit</i>...

307
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,340
<i>You know, he's obviously been
at the same team for so long.</i>

308
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,180
<i>I think change is always exciting.</i>

309
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,180
[reporter 3] Lewis,
can we bring you in on this?

310
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,600
What about these Ferrari stories?

311
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,940
Yeah, I think naturally, uh,
when you're in the contract negotiations,

312
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,280
there's always gonna be speculation.

313
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,600
And I think ultimately, that's, uh...

314
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,880
Unless you hear from me,
then that's all it is, speculation.

315
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,400
-[reporter 3] Have Ferrari been in touch?
-No.

316
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,160
[Buxton] Rumors don't come
from nowhere in Formula 1.

317
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,300
Of course, there's gonna be question marks
over whether Lewis

318
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,840
will re-sign with Mercedes.

319
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,940
But if you're not talking to every team,
then you're not doing your job.

320
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,540
[intriguing music plays]

321
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,200
-Don't speak. We are on Netflix.
-No, no, I know.

322
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,180
[Vasseur chuckles]

323
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,220
[in French] I don't want to talk.
There's Netflix.

324
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,680
[laughs]

325
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:55,080
{\an8}[producer in English] So, uh, I'm not
allowed to ask you about Mercedes, am I?

326
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,720
[laughs]

327
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,760
You will ask Toto about Mercedes.

328
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,620
[Wolff] I completely understand

329
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:07,120
that Lewis needs to look out
what is the best opportunity for himself.

330
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,980
But what we agreed very early on
was that we wouldn't talk to anybody else

331
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:15,600
without being transparent
and honest with each other.

332
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,420
[Russell] With Lewis, if he were to leave,

333
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,300
{\an8}that would put Mercedes
in a bit of a tricky spot

334
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:33,180
{\an8}because it would almost look like
he's lost faith in the team.

335
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,020
[Hamilton] Every time you do a contract,
I think you'd be an idiot

336
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:42,000
if you didn't analyze
where you currently are

337
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,020
and what other opportunities there are.

338
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:47,700
Then you have to make a decision
whether you explore other alternatives

339
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:50,340
or you just continue on
with what you're doing.

340
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,520
[team member 1]
So, Barcelona then, this weekend.

341
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,900
We've closed the gap to second
to one point.

342
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,540
The big questions are obviously gonna be
around the effectiveness of the upgrades.

343
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:02,540
So it'll be fascinating to see
where we go from here.

344
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,640
Um...

345
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,100
We're not expecting to see
a big shift in performance.

346
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,300
[team member 2] I think downplay.

347
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,980
[both team members]
Under-promising and over-delivering.

348
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:15,760
We're still determined.
We're not defeatist. But we're realistic.

349
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,880
Um, and then the track changes.

350
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,180

353

the question is,</i>

354
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,840
<i>will the new upgrade be enough
to take the fight to Aston Martin</i>

{\an8}<i>in the battle for second place

00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,640
[Wolff] The team have worked flat out
to bring an upgrade.

359
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,760
[Hamilton] I hope the car's gonna be a lot
better. Whether it'll work, we'll see.

360
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:10,500
{\an8}[Russell] We're there to fight, to win.
And we will need to raise our game.

361
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,000
[Wolff] We believe that the upgrade
is gonna function well.

[announcer] Well done to George.

452
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:40,040
[cheering]

453
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,180
[Wolff] The sheer effect of a podium
and seeing the drivers up there

454
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,260
is great for the team.

455
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,040
[announcer] <i>In second place,
Lewis Hamilton!</i>

456
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,840
[Wolff] Now we need to be able to channel
that positiveness in the right direction.

457
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,120
[cheering]

458
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,140
[announcer] <i>Well done to Max Verstappen.</i>

459
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,480
Fanboys, first row.

460
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,820
[Wolff in German] Do you think
we should take a team photo?

461
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,800
[man] No. I don't think so.

462
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,940
-[Wolff] No.
-We...

463
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,220
[in English] We don't lower our standards.

464
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,460
No, I think we need to be...

465
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,260
I know we need to celebrate the moment.

466
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,380
Yeah, but you're absolutely right.
No team photo for second and third.

467
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,520
[Wolff] Barcelona was one race.

468
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,240
I don't wanna grab on to one single straw

469
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,100
and see all the positiveness in that.

470
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,960
[reporter] Do you see the light
at the end of the tunnel?

471
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,120
Um...

472
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:58,720
[Patrick] The person with the most amount
of pressure on them is going to be Toto.

473
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:03,560
He can't promise that, you know,
we're gonna win the championship again.

474
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,380
He can't promise we're gonna win races.

475
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,720
The best thing
that Toto can guarantee Lewis

476
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,900
is that he's gonna listen to him.

477
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,360
[Hamilton] Boss.

478
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,280
Got good pictures around.

479
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:44,520
Who would've thought we would be
where we are in the world today?

480
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:51,320
Last year, the development of the car,
you weren't happy with me.

481
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,280
[both chuckle]

482
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,540
Yeah.

483
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:00,180
You know, sticking to the concept
from last year,

484
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:03,060
holding on to it because of
the encouraging results at the end...

485
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,060
-That's the biggest failure.
-[Wolff] The biggest.

486
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,460
Um...

487
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,900
Because last year
lead us in the wrong, you know...

488
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,560
Yeah.

489
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,140
[Wolff] The time has come
to cut our losses

490
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:18,320
and say that the concept of this car
is never gonna work.

491
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,080
We gotta change it for next year.

492
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:23,360
For me, personally,

493
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:28,000
you know, when you see the step
that Aston Martin made over the winter,

494
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:31,180
shows that if we get it right
with the concept of the car,

495
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,100
you know, the aero and the balance,

496
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,700
we can win a championship.

497
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:40,620
But I don't want to wait until 2026
when we have the new engine regulations.

498
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,240
[Hamilton] Frick, me neither.

499
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,880
You can be here for, like, 20 more years,
30 more years.

500
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,560
I can't. [laughs]

501
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,620
Well, who says that?

502
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,820
This is precious years for me.

503
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,700
I don't know.

504
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,400
Lewis, you're much more
than a racing driver.

505
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,380
Much more
than the seven-time world champion.

506
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:05,440
You are one of the... the people
that lead this team forward.

507
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:21,460
[camera shutter clicks]

508
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,800
[melancholy music plays]

509
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,720
[Hamilton] I've worked with Toto now...

510
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,060
Uh, I think this is my tenth year
with the team.

511
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,100
[melancholy music continues]

512
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,480
[Hamilton] I've learned
a huge amount from him,

513
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,260
and I'd like to think
there's at least one or two things

514
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,740
that he may have learned from me.

515
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,160
[Wolff] In every relationship,

516
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,220
you will have moments
where your objectives may differ.

517
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,320
It's just part of how life goes.

518
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,200
In the context of our relationship,

519
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,180
he's a loyal guy.

520
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,140
[Hamilton] Toto and I
have a lot in common.

521
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:15,200
We're both massively competitive
and hate losing.

522
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,360
Okay, we've had two difficult years,

523
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:23,860
but... I still have so much belief

524
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:27,100
that Mercedes
and all these people within this team

525
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:29,200
have the ability to build a great car.

526
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,960
You've just got to take a leap of faith.

527
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,980
[cell phone chimes]

528
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:45,300
[reporter 1] <i>Lewis Hamilton
has signed a new two-year contract.</i>

529
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:52,520
[Wolff] The thought of Lewis at Ferrari
in a red overall,

530
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,140
it wouldn't suit him.

531
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,180
[reporter 2] <i>The seven-time world champion
has signed a new two-year contract</i>

532
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,880
<i>with Mercedes until 2025.</i>

533
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,460
[Hamilton] Toto, he's listened.

534
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:12,760
And there just never feels like a time
where I'm not gonna be a Mercedes driver.

535
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,080
That's my home. It's my family.

536
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,380
[woman] Bye-bye.

537
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:21,780
-[Hamilton] Let's go. See you next week.
-[man] See you next week. Take care.

538
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,980
[Wolff] If I would have a glass ball,
to say to you,

539
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,660
"I am delivering the eighth title,"
would be foolish.

540
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,560
Um, what I can guarantee is

541
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,380
that the team
is gonna be giving its utmost

542
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:42,160
to bring that eighth title to him
that he deserves.

543
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,780
But at the moment,
the most important thing

544
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:48,680
is to finish second
in the Constructors Championship.

545
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,820
Beat Aston Martin and Ferrari.

546
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,460
And... And that will be the aim now.

547
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,260
{\an8}[Szafnauer] Our season so far
has been disappointing.

548
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,000
[commentator 3] <i>There's contact!</i>

549
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:07,940
[Ocon] I got hit, guys.

00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,920
[commentator 3] <i>Double DNF for Alpine.</i>

551
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,140
[Gasly] For fuck's sake.

552
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,800
[Szafnauer] I have to do better.

553
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,380
The buck will stop with me.

554
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,760
{\an8}[producer] Three, two, one, go.

555
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,840
{\an8}[Ricciardo] I'm back.

556
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,420
It was good.

557
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,000
I got nothing to lose.

558
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,100
The dream for me is to...
to get back at Red Bull Racing.

559
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,000
[Padros] <i>Be careful.</i>

[commentator 3] <i>And Leclerc locks up!</i>

562
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,660
We need to get results
if we want to survive.

[Leclerc] Yes.

18

the main target is to beat the Mercedes.

a good chance of beating them.

00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,000
[suspenseful music continues]

156
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,960
[team member] Good evening,
we'll start with Fred's introduction.

157
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,600
Yeah, a quick one.
This event will be difficult.

158
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,260
And perhaps a strange one
with the track layout.

159
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,120
But I think the most important will be

160
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,400
for us to stay
completely focused on the event

161
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,500
and, uh, not to be focused
on what's happening outside.

162
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,920
[Vasseur in French] We arrived
in Las Vegas 20 points behind Mercedes.

163
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:52,140
But we know it's the money time
with the races remaining.

164
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,960
[in English] We want to be
in front of Mercedes.

165
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,120
Thank you.

166
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,940
[reporter] <i>After all the hype,
we're finally gonna see some cars</i>

167
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,860

on this circuit.</i>

168

{\an8}[Adami] <i>All clear.</i>

{\an8}[Sainz] Copy.

170
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,080
{\an8}The practice sessions are so important.

<i>Carlos Sainz taking to the track
for the very first time.</i>

173
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,580
[Williams] For the drivers, it's their
first opportunity on that circuit

174
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,780
to learn every nuance
for Qualifying and for the race.

175
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,160
{\an8}[dramatic music plays]

00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,380
{\an8}[Padros] <i>Track clear. Mode race.</i>

177
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:36,720
{\an8}[Leclerc] Free practices, they are
all about trying to understand the track

178
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,600
and to achieve the best car setup
and strategy

179
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,000
that will come out on top.

180
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,000
[Patrick] Las Vegas is a track
that none of the drivers have driven.

181
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,440
And what this does
is it levels out the playing field.

182
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,720
{\an8}[Chan] <i>Mode charge.
Mode charge. And keep the pace up.</i>

183
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,720
[Bottas] Yeah, the grip is...
Grip is pretty shocking here.

184
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,320
{\an8}[Verstappen] It's really very cool
driving on the Strip.

185
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,500
Is it the best track on Earth?

186
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,040
Yeah, I have very little grip.

187
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,280
{\an8}No, for sure not.

188
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,920
[Lambiase] <i>Okay, understood.</i>

189
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,680
{\an8}[Hamilton] Vegas turned out to be
incredibly slippery.

190
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,820
{\an8}-I don't have that grip.
-[Bono] <i>Okay, copy.</i>

191
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:27,060
So I do anticipate
it's gonna be a difficult weekend.

192
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,600
Especially with Ferrari.
We've got a lot of work to do.

193
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,020
{\an8}[Sainz] I'm struggling with traction.

194
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,260
There's a lot of hype around Vegas.

195
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,840
I would like to open a lap
just to confirm my feeling.

196
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,400
[Adami] <i>Okay, understood.</i>

197
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,680
[Sainz] There's obviously a lot
of uncertainties about the racetrack,

198
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:50,080
but everyone's excited to see how it goes
and see if we can put on a good show.

199
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,540
[thudding]

200
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,020
[Sainz groans]

201
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,280
[groans]

202
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,440
[Sainz] Fucking hell.

203
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,520
What was that?

204
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,320
[groans]

205
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,200
My back.

206
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,240
[commentator 3] <i>Carlos Sainz has stopped.</i>

207
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,920
<i>We got a red flag.</i>

208
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,960
[commentator 4]
<i>That was severe, wasn't it?</i>

209
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,380
[Adami] <i>Are you okay?</i>

210
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,820
[Sainz] Yeah, but fuck's sake.

211
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,340
I hit a drain cover, I think.

212
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,580
[commentator 2] <i>Sainz appears
to have hit a drain cover,</i>

213
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,800
<i>and that could be some serious damage.</i>

214
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,980
[Sainz] <i>The floor is gonna be destroyed.</i>

215
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,140
[tense music plays]

216
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,540
[music fades]

217
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:52,480
This is a... a nightmare scenario
for... for Carlos and Ferrari.

218
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,560
[commentator 2] <i>The team
are now watching that back in the garage.</i>

219
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,400
<i>Man, that was a big hit.</i>

220
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,180
[Buxton] That is not
a small amount of damage.

221
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,540
And where it's hit the car,

222
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:11,760
Ferrari now have to build
a brand-new car from scratch.

223
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,620
But you have a certain allocation

224
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:19,720
of engines, gear boxes
that you can use throughout the season.

225
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,480
And they've used
more than their season's allocation.

226
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,520
There is no waiver.

227
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,440
There is no route around it.

228
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:35,920
Ferrari now face a ten-place grid penalty
for the race.

229
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,340
[Williams] It's not an easy situation
to be in.

230
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,720
And if you're Ferrari

231
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,240
and you're competing
against your arch rival, Mercedes,

232
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,640
for P2 in the championship,

233
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,220
it is the last thing that you want.

234
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:54,340
[woman] You're gonna be late
for the press conference. You need to go.

235
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,200
[man 1] Have you seen this video of Sainz?

236
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,640
Watch. Hang on. It replays in a second.

237
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,280
Watch up there.

238
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,240
It goes off like a bomb.

239
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,440
[reporter] It's been a very unfortunate
start to the on-track proceedings.

240
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,860
And, Fred, perhaps
we could start with you.

241
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,340
Have you had a chance
to look at the car yet?

242
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,500
The situation is that, uh,

243
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,980
we damaged completely the monocoque,

244
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,160
the engine, the battery.

245
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,880
And, uh,

246
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,000
I think it's just unacceptable.

247
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:40,120
Well, let's look bigger picture because...

248
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,580
But this one is a good one.

249
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,080
I don't need to have
a bigger picture than this one.

250
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,260
[reporter] Okay.

251
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:49,200
But, Fred, I did just want to ask you
about this event,

252
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,920
if we can just talk about
the Las Vegas Grand Prix.

253
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,040
Yeah, guys, but I... [chuckles]

254
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,620
I'm not sure
that is the topic for me today. Not, uh...

255
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,660
We had a very tough FP1.
This will cost us a fortune.

256
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,600
With a fucked-up decision for Carlos.

257
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,140
But we have to change the chassis,
half of the car,

258
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,220
or two-thirds of the car.

259
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:11,440
Okay, the show is the show,
and everything is going well, but, uh,

260
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,240
I think it's just unacceptable
from the F1 today.

261
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,580
-[reporter] Okay, well, this is the last...
-Fred is upset.

262
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,320
I am, Toto,
but you would be upset in my situation.

263
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:26,000
Fred, let's look at 2023 as a whole, okay?

264
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,020
Your first year
as team principal of Ferrari.

265
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,960
You're putting yourself into more trouble.

266
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,480
-No, but...
-I've known him for 20 years. He has...

267
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,860
[Toto laughs]

268
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,700
-[reporter] Fred, can we just...
-Can I leave now or...

269
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:45,640
-[reporter] Can we reflect on the year?
-Ask a question to Toto about something.

270
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,200
[reporter] All right. Well, look,
we'll come back to you, Fred.

271
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,620
-We'll come back to you.
-Sure.

with the bad luck we had with the drain.

282

We know it has made overtaking Mercedes

290

we need to work as hard as possible

[cheering]

490
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:53,340
[in French] I think, personally,
Carlos had a great performance.

491
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:58,040
Now we're four points behind Mercedes.
We know what we have to do in Abu Dhabi.

492
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:03,640
[Hamilton in English] We lost
a lot of points today to Ferrari, um,

493
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,920
which is really unfortunate.

494
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,920
But we'll go to the last race,

495
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,400
we'll fight and give it everything we got.

496
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:18,660
[Wolff] We have a problem.

497
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:22,460
Clearly, we've underperformed.

498
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,000
Certainly not what, uh, what we aimed for.

499
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:29,420
So this is, let's say,
a dynamic situation.

500
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:34,180
Fighting for P2
is a formidable challenge against Fred.

501
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,880
So obviously, the pressure, um, is big.

502
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,640
We just gotta beat the Ferraris.

Go and see my parents.

509
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,680

to do first, though.

510
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,240
Oh yeah, I've got a race.

511
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,360
Yeah, true.

512
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,400

some fighting talk.

-[Piastri] Oh.
-No, we don't do that.

No.

-We're not that type of team, you know?
-We do our talking on the track.

516

Bang on, Oscar.

It's relentless.

[Ricciardo] Hey, guys.

00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,840
[Buxton] Thousands of laps completed.

And there's still plenty to fight for
in this last race of the season.

And it's not just the fight for second

535

in the Constructors Championship
that's at stake.

Morning.

541
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,800
[Zak Brown] I wish
we weren't racing Fernando

542
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:39,400
'cause he's capable of pulling off
some miraculous... results.

543
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,120
Fourth will be amazing
given where we started.

544
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,800
I think if it's fifth,
we're all gonna be pissed off,

545
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:51,120
especially 'cause the last couple races,
we've clearly been quicker,

546
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,340

-[man] You heard from Lawrence?
-[Brown] I've had a text from Lawrence.

I wouldn't say that was friendly... banter.

549

for PG TV either.

550
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,800
[man] Yeah? What did he say?

551
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,680
Uh, why don't you ask him?

552
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:17,820
{\an8}Big weekend here in Abu Dhabi.
We have an 11-point lead over Aston Martin

553
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,920
for fourth in the championship.

554
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,820
It's hotter today, no?

555
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:24,540
I would've never thought
we would have been here.

556
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:27,460
You know, they started the season
second-quickest team,

557
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,280
and we started the season
probably the ninth quickest.

558
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,480
-It's gone very quick.
-It has gone very quickly.

559
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,800
I believe we have the faster car,
we have the better driver lineup.

560
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,720
But now we need to close the deal.

561
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,280
[producer] Any messages for Lawrence?

562
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,060
Game on.

563
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,440
Good to see you.

564
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,180
[Lawrence Stroll] We definitely hit a lull
in the middle of the season.

565
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:58,620
Uh, we made some mistakes,
and we were just too slow.

566
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,640
I think it made everybody
a little bit hungrier

567
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:04,180
to finish stronger in the last race
than our competitors.

568
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,220
How are you?

569
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,380
P2 or P3?

570
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,460
P3.

571
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,140
Where are you starting, seventh?

572
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,940
If I push on his rear, you crash into him.

573
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,000
Good for you. Good for you.

574
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:23,140
[Alonso] I think the team really deserves
this year to finish fourth.

575
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,600
{\an8}And I feel motivated.

576
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:29,240
McLaren is doing
an outstanding job this year.

577
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,700
Ten-pin bowling.

578
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,860
[Alonso] So it's gonna be a tight fight.

579
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,180
[Norris] Everyone thought
they'd be title challengers.

580
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,240
But they started strong.

581
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,880
And we went up.

582
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,060
They went down.

583
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,140
Who knows?

584
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,060
What?

585
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,100
I send you bad luck.

586
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,840

587
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,420
-Bad luck!
-[laughter]

588
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,960
[Norris] Our final job
is to finish ahead of them.

589
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:58,660
There is more pressure
going up against Fernando Alonso.

590
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:01,720
But if there's one team
we really want to beat, it's them.

591
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,740
This is it.
It all comes down to one last round.

592
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,820
But it's pretty tight between all of us.

593
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,980
[Buxton] Further back down the paddock,

594
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:18,660
every team's objectives
are to finish ahead of their rivals.

595
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:22,000
I think we have a faster race car
than we expected here.

596
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,900
I'm looking forward to it.

597
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,460
See you later on.

598
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,940
[tense music plays]

599
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:35,220
[Steiner] Going into Abu Dhabi,
the car will not be a lot different.

600
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:38,560
So we need some help from something
to get some points.

601
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,340
Otherwise, we finish last.

602
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:45,520
{\an8}But you always go out there, do your best,
and try to make the miracle happen.

Thank you very much. Thank you.

609
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,620
How do you find it at Alpine?

610
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:16,940
Somehow, the team has so much more
potential than what we're showing.

611
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,580
You know, like...

612
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,240
[Gasly] Everyone was disappointed
with the performance

613
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,060
we showed since the start of the year.

614
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,880
{\an8}But there've been quite a few changes.

615
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:28,260
{\an8}Well, being on the podium in Zandvoort
was, uh... was amazing.

616
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:33,860
Now, with Esteban,
the best it's been since... since ten years.

617
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,940
It's a good place to... to be in.

618
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,980
[Wolff] Still not in a good place,
the car.

619
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:42,420
-I'll see what I can do with it.
-I'm sure you can do something with it.

620
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,620
I don't wanna see this car again
after today.

621
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,160
[Wolff] It's the last one. Last one.

622
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:49,540
Let's do the best
out of the last 90 minutes of the season.

623
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,560
Yep. I'll give it everything.

624
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:00,180
[Wolff] We're coming to the last race
with Ferrari four points behind.

625
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,860
George and Lewis wanna give it
all they have

626
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,500
to finish second
in the Constructor Championship.

627
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,200
-Ready for it?
-[man] Yeah. You?

628
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,860
Yeah, I'm excited.

629
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,980
Gonna be a good one.

630
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:15,360

seventh in the Constructors Championship.

752
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,660
It's a proud moment.

753
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,280
{\an8}Thanks, James.

754
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,540
{\an8}This is just the start
of really good things.

755
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,400
[Slade] Kev, usual story.

756
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,400
{\an8}<i>I'm afraid we were P20.</i>

757
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:13,260
{\an8}[Magnussen] Thanks
for all the effort this year.

758
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,480
It's been a tough old one.

759
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:21,580
[commentator 1] <i>It's a bottom-of-the-table
finish for Guenther Steiner and Haas.</i>

760
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:31,900
<i>The dominant Dutchman,
winning for the 19th time this season,</i>

761
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:36,200
<i>and Red Bull end the season
beaten just once in the grand prix format.</i>

762
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,280
<i>In the battle for P2, Mercedes held on.</i>

763
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,740
{\an8}Can I do some burnouts, okay?

764
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:46,980
{\an8}[Padros] <i>No burnouts, please.
No burnouts to the grid.</i>

765
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:47,960
[Leclerc groans]

766
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:50,420
Not even this, for fuck's sake.

767
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:57,780
{\an8}[Dudley] <i>I'll see you up there
on that podium. It's been a while.</i>

768
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,320
[Russell] Oh yeah.
We're on a path back to the top.

769
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,200
Come on, guys.

770
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,460
[upbeat music plays]

771
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,180
[team member] Fucking hell,
give me a hug. That is fantastic.

772
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:09,220
[upbeat music continues]

773
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:16,080
George, you made 2,500 people happy.

774
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:22,060
[Russell] I thought you were gonna tell me
that was my bonus, 2,500.

775
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,400
[Wolff] P2 is an... is an important one,

776
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:31,740
but at the same time,
this sport is all about... about winning.

777
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:33,640
And that's the mentality in the team.

778
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,760
Next season,
we start with a completely new car.

779
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,020
Hopefully back to success.

780
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:42,540
{\an8}[Leclerc yells]

781
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:44,680
{\an8}Fuck!

782
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:52,280
I think that in those moments,
as much as you are disappointed

783
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:53,860
by not achieving your targets...

784
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:03,200
as a team, we also need to be happy
of what we have achieved.

785
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:07,600
I also believe we finished
that season on a high

786
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,920
with good momentum for next year.

787
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,540
[cheering]

788
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:20,140
[Vasseur in French] For me,

789
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:26,020
the DNA of a race team
is to always improve and get better.

790
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:28,960
It's reflected
in the work we do every day,

791
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,660
our points, our number of wins,

792
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:33,180
our ranking in the tournament.

793
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:35,180
Although that depends on the others too.

794
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:39,200
My main goal is that the team works
even better next year than this year.

795
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:44,260
{\an8}Well done, guys.
What an incredible season.

796
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,060
Have a good break,
and we'll come back stronger next year.

797
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,800
[Lawrence Stroll] We haven't even begun.
There's a tremendous amount more to go.

798
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,740
-[Vowles] Are you all right?
-I'm okay. You?

799
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:56,100
[Vowles] Just really well done.

800
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:57,940
Very impressive
what you've done this year.

801
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:00,260
Anything we can help, we're there.

802
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,660
[Vowles] I'll let you know.
Just keep doing what you're doing.

803
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:03,800
That's what we'll try to do.

804
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:04,740
[Vowles] Fair enough.

805
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:08,080
[Lawrence Stroll] We made some mistakes,
but as far as next year goes,

806
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:11,100
stay tuned because you'll see us
take some major steps

807
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:13,540
and, I believe,
fighting for world championships.

808
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:15,800
-[Brown] Well done, guys.
-Great job.

809
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,040
[Brown] Strong season.

810
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,300
[Brown] Next year, I think
we can be fighting at the top.

811
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:22,880
Our intention is to keep going,
keep making the car faster.

812
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:26,880
So I see no reason why both our drivers
can't be challenging for wins next year.

813
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:29,500
[music intensifies]

814
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:35,340
[commentator 1] <i>Max Verstappen
wins 19 grand prix in a single season.</i>

815
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:40,640
[commentator 5] <i>It is another victory.
What a year it has been for him!</i>

816
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:45,640
We've won 95.4% of the races.

817
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,540
We won all of them bar one.

818
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:49,440
We've had 30 podiums.

819
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:52,080
Max is the most successful driver
in a season.

820
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:57,200
It's been unbelievable,
uh, for a sportsman to hit

821
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:00,580
that kind of form for that period of time.

822
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:02,920
It's... It's outstanding.

823
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:06,660
We'll never see
this kind of winning again,

824
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:08,560
certainly in, probably, my lifetime

825
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:09,980
or in any of our lifetimes.

826
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,720
{\an8}And even if we won 50%
of what we've achieved this year,

827
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,360
{\an8}that might be good enough
to defend the championships next year.

828
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,380
[cheering]

829

[Steiner] Fucking hell.

832
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:31,920
It's been a long season.

833
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:34,760
We finished last.

834
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:38,420
It doesn't feel good, you know?

835
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:42,620
[somber music plays]

836
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:50,640
[Steiner] I always said, "We are not here
to be last. We are here to compete."

837
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:54,540
The buck stops here,
and I have to do the best for the team.

838
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:00,520
I need to phone Gene up.

839
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:04,320
Hi, Gene.

840
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,140
Fucking hell.

841
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:08,200
Fuck, man, this year...

842
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,240
[producer] Thank you, Guenther.

843
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,060
You're such a pleasure to chat with
in this chair.

844
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:17,880
I mean that genuinely. Thank you.

845
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,360
[Steiner] No problem. You're welcome.

846
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,220
And you know, if I wouldn't like it,
I wouldn't speak.

847
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:24,520

1
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,000
[producer] I'm gonna
ask you some questions.

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,040
[Vasseur] Okay, but I'm not
in the police station. [chuckles]

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,460
[producer] This is our first chat together
on the show. We're gonna start.

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,740
-Okay.
-[producer] Yeah.

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,440
Fred Vasseur, team principal, Ferrari.

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,240
[dramatic music plays]

7
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,080
[Buxton] Ferrari is more than
a brand. It's more than a car company.

8
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,900
For Italians, it's life.

9
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,720
There are two religions in Italy.

10
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,780
There's the Catholic Church,
and there's Ferrari.

11
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,360
[crowd cheers]

12
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,740
[dramatic music continues]

13
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,620
[reporter in Italian] <i>Ferrari have
confirmed that they have appointed</i>

14
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:57,120
<i>Frédéric Vasseur
as their new team principal.</i>

15
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,980
[mechanic 1] Jesus Christ.

16
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,140
[mechanic 2] Fuck's sake.

17
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:06,160
[male fan 1] He's never done this job.
What the heck did he come here to do?

18
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,220
[female fan] He doesn't
even speak Italian.

19
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,040
Exactly.
A team like Ferrari that is a family.

20
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,660
It's important.

21
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,760
[female fan] Exactly.

22
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,800
A top team like Ferrari can't afford
to make those kinds of mistakes

23
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,260
in front of the whole world.

24
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,760
[male fan 2] This guy has to make it work.

25
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,000
[male fan 3] The team principal before
was Binotto.

26
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,680
Let's hope that Vasseur
manages to be a little better.

27
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,100
[Buxton in English] The role of Ferrari
team principal is a poisoned chalice.

28
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,760
[clicks his tongue]

29
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,820
{\an8}[Buxton] It's the most pressurized
position in world sport.

30
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,020
{\an8}Does he know what he's let himself in for?

31
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,480
I have to be serious.

32
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,900
[producer] No, please don't be serious.
We wanted the real you.

33
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,000
[blows raspberry]

34
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,820
[laughs]

35
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,420
[engine revs]

36
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,280
[tense orchestral music plays]

37
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,360
[Buxton] Ferrari is passion and history

38
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,880
and elegance and glamour,

39
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,760
Italian style,

40
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,840
and speed.

41
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,980
The only team
that's taken part in every year

42
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:32,320
of the Formula 1 World Championship,
all the way back to 1950.

43
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,880
They are the most successful team
the sport has ever known.

44
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:42,060
[commentator 1] <i>Michael Schumacher
takes his 85th Formula 1 win.</i>

45
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,780
{\an8}But they've not won a championship
in a decade and a half.

46
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,240
Ferrari, in 2022,

47
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,940
made countless mistakes,

48
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,140
handed away so many advantages.

49
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:02,120
-[Padros] <i>Stay out, stay out.</i>
-[Leclerc] Fuck, fuck!

50
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,080
{\an8}No!

51
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,100
{\an8}[commentator 2] <i>For the third time
this season,</i>

52
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:11,640
<i>Charles Leclerc, when leading a race,
won't go on to finish it.</i>

53
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,080
[Buxton] And that's something
that a new team boss

54
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,000
will need to change.

55
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,180
[Vasseur in French] I joined Ferrari
over the winter.

56
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,620
It all hit me like an enormous wave.

57
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:31,060
I didn't have time to anticipate it.
It was just there.

58
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,400
[Williams in English] Fred's
quite a surprising choice for Ferrari.

59
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,200
{\an8}Ferrari would normally choose
a very serious individual.

60
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,880
Fred is a unique character.

61
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:48,200
{\an8}I've known Fred for 25 years.
He's straightforward, no bullshit.

62
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,760
But he can also be a bit cheeky.

63
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,800
[producer in French] A bit higher.
Like that. And look at me.

64
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,180
Like that. [chuckles]

65
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:01,080
[in English] You couldn't have
a less Ferrari person running Ferrari.

66
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,020
And he's not even Italian.

67
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,780
[in Italian] Today,
I need to speak Italian to the press.

68
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,920
-Yes.
-[in French] So...

69
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,260
[in Italian] We can start.

70
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,240
[in English] In French...

71
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,360
[laughs]

72
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,960
Fred Vasseur was team boss
at Alfa Romeo for six seasons.

73
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,420
And it's a big step up

74
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,380
for Fred to move
from a back-of-the-grid team

75
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,800
to Ferrari.

76
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,300
But he's not
some wet-behind-the-ears greenhorn.

77
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:42,180
He has been involved in motorsport
for over three decades.

78
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,420
Half the grid
owe their careers to Fred Vasseur.

79
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,840
Ferrari wanted a new set of ideas,

80
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,000
a new direction,
and Fred represents that something new.

81
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,640
[in Italian] For the fans, it's important
to say something in Italian.

82
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,980
Forza Ferrari...

83
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,740
-Okay.
-This always.

84
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,560
[in English] At the end of each sentence,
<i>"Forza Ferrari."</i>

85
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,800
[in Italian] Yes. Very good.

86
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,920
Perfect.

87
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,020
[Vasseur] <i>Forza Ferrari.</i>

88
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,060
<i>Forza Ferrari.</i>

89
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,680
-[producer in English] How's your Italian?
-I won't speak Italian today.

90
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,800
-[producer] Okay.
-[laughs]

91
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,280
[tense music plays]

92
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,980
[Vasseur] I know the pressure
from the press and the media is on me.

93
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,260
It's something I have to learn
to work with.

94
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:36,340
[reporter] Fred, now, uh, I also
want to hear how is it going so far?

95
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,120
So far, it's intense. [chuckles]
As you can imagine.

96
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,980
But, uh, you can feel
the responsibility for the team.

97
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,140
It's a great honor,
but at the end of the day,

98
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,220
I think the most important
is to be successful.

99
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,240
That, uh, we will have to... to deliver.

100
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:55,740
[Vasseur] So far, it's not the best start
for the season, for sure,

101
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,560
and, uh, we made mistakes.

102
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,600
{\an8}[Leclerc] No, no, no, no. Come on.

103
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,400
Guys, no power.

104
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,280
[commentator 2] <i>And there's contact!</i>

105
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,340
{\an8}[Leclerc] That's it.

106
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,680
{\an8}[Sainz] We're gonna crash.

107
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,680
{\an8}[Adami] <i>Yeah, copy.</i>

108
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,260
Definitely the worst start
of... of a season ever.

109
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,820
Clearly, the objective of Ferrari
is to win.

110
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,800
You need to get results
if you want to survive.

111
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,960
[interviewer] Hello, Charles.

112
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,660
[Williams] Coming in and taking over
somebody else's team,

113
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,180
which Fred has effectively done...

114
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,220
That's been Mattia's team
for quite a while.

115
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,820
That's not an easy situation,

116
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,700
because this is not his car.

117
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,940
Fred is inheriting the team, the car,

118
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:56,400
and two incredibly competitive drivers
from his predecessor.

119
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,840
[Sainz] My objective
is to be world champion.

120
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,960
And your teammate is one more of those
who you want to beat.

121
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,280
{\an8}[Leclerc] I know that he's my teammate,

122
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,040
{\an8}but I also know I want to beat him
as much as he wants to beat me.

123
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,060
I just want to win and beat everyone.

124
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,240
It won't be, uh, an easy season for me.

125

[Buxton] Monza is the home of the <i>tifosi.</i>

136
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,980
Fred knows what the expectations are,

137
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,860
and bare minimum is winning races.

138

The <i>tifosi</i> expects.

140

<i>Ferrari could do good things

143
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,280
[radio host continues speaking Italian]

144
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,540
Coming into Monza,
Ferrari currently find themselves fourth,

145
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:33,820
and it's definitely not
where the <i>tifosi</i> would expect them to be.

146
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:39,180
We want to do a better job
with better results.

147
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:43,580
[Vasseur in French] Now we're going
to Monza at a difficult time

148
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,700
because Ferrari wants to win again,
and it's been a while since we have.

149
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,220
We have a bit of hope
because Monza is a fast race

150
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,160
and that suits our car better,

151
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,160
but we're still going into the unknown.

152
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,660
There will be a lot of expectations

153
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,840
from the <i>tifosi,</i> the sponsors,
and Ferrari in general.

154

157

[Leclerc in English] It's been
a very difficult season.

158
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,180
There's a lot of work to do
in order to catch up.

you wanna perform at your highest level

They're all <i>tifosi.</i>

I feel like crying, Carlos.

176

They all say hi to you
with such emotion. It's incredible.

Are you okay? Relaxed?

[music fades]

181
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,720
[reporter in italian] Here he is,
Frédéric Vasseur.

182
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,100
-Hi, Fred.
-[Vasseur] Good evening.

183
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,580
[in English] We just want to know which
kind of feelings did you have this morning

184
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,200
coming here at the track,

185
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,520
seeing all the red <i>tifosi</i> around
cheering for you.

186
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,440
I wanted to avoid
to have an extra pressure on the team,

187
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,600
but I think that we have to stay calm
and focus on what we are doing,

188
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:35,220
not to overshoot any expectation
or something like this.

189
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,360
There's always hope at Monza
of a Ferrari victory,

190
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:45,640
but in 2023, Red Bull have won
every single grand prix.

191
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,500
Where is the TV pen?

192
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,460
I don't know.

193
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,420
Paul, where are we going now?

194
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,080
[Paul] Going back in,
then we'll go up to the paddock.

195
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,340
-I thought Fred was just following me.
-[all laugh]

196
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,140
[Vasseur] We are following each other.

197
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,000
[Buxton] And so the question now
is how do you beat Red Bull?

198
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:07,680
And you then have Mercedes, who are second
in the Constructors Championship,

199
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,220
doing... [chuckles]
...so much better than Ferrari.

200
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,300
That's massive pressure on Fred.

{\an8}<i>And Carlos Sainz comes home

{\an8}<i>to beat his teammate, Charles Leclerc,
and take that final podium place.</i>

359
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:19,860
[in Italian] They're not a team anymore.
They're not a cohesive team.

360
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:23,840
Today we risked not getting any points.

361
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,800
They could have gone out, both of them.

362
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:32,660
[Williams in English] I can't tell you
the pain a team principal will be feeling

363
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,040
watching your two drivers
battle on the track.

364
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,740
There is so much risk involved.

365
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,560
They could've taken each other out.

366
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:45,180
That's when the TP needs to step in

367
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,540
and tell their drivers,
"Dial it down a bit."

368
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,000
There's just too much at stake.

369
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,800
[Vasseur] It was not a good result
at all for us.

370
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,000
Passion around the team,
the expectation is always very high

371
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,540
and difficult to manage.

372
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,700
[man on radio in Italian]
<i>Team Principal Frédéric Vasseur,</i>

<i>a man about whom there'd been many doubts.</i>

374
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,100
<i>Should we trust him?</i>

375
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,620
[fan 1] I would have kept Binotto.

376
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:22,220
Facts are facts.
The reality is that we are losing.

377
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:26,040
[fan 2] We have hit rock bottom.

378
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,640
This is a bad year.

379
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,980
[fan 3] Jesus Christ.

380
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,920
[fan 4] We have to ask Vasseur
why the car is slow, eh?

381
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,400
But above all,
why is Verstappen going so strong?

382
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,560
[fan 5] His car is better.

383
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,120
[fan 4] Fucking hell.

384
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,540
-[Leclerc in English] All good?
-So far. Before the lunch, all good.

-[Vasseur laughs]
-Before they catch up.

386
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,660
[Vasseur chuckles]

387
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,880
[Vasseur in French] Come on.
What did you do this morning?

388
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,900
[Vasseur in English] How is the life?
Your life?

389
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,940
-[Sainz] My life in general?
-Yeah.

390
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,860
Still single?

391
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,680
Anyway, changing subject...

392
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,580
[laughter]

393
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,500
[Sainz] How is the team?

394
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,220
I think, in terms of mood,
it's, uh, much better.

395
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:29,460
[Vasseur in French] We have to behave
as a team in both the good and bad times.

396
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,100
And I think the team
needs to stick together.

397
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:35,820
We often forget what "team" means,
because it's very important.

398
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:39,820
[in English] We have to continue to push
in this direction. We are not far away.

399
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,780
I think we have to put everything together

400
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,920
to try to improve the situation

401
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,460
to work on every single pillar
of the performance.

402
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:50,460
We are all trying to do better,
you know, than what we maybe...

403
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,520
Probably that we are trying
to overshoot the railings.

404
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,920
[Sainz] That's what I mean.

405
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,760
[Vasseur] In Monza,

406
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,220
the fight on track between you,

407
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,140
it's too much.

408
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,760
We can't race like this.

409
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,020
Yeah, maybe that
was a little bit over-the-top.

410
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:06,900
[Sainz] Yeah.

411
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,480
[Vasseur] As a team perspective,
we need to work together to win.

412
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,280
Yeah.

413
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,220
We have to improve
and to put everything together

414
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,500
from Friday to Sunday.

415
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,020
[Leclerc] Yep.

416
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,080
[Sainz] It will be a lot better.

417
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,120
We couldn't do it in Monza.
Let's try and do it in Singapore, no?

418
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,540
[Vasseur] Let's push.

419
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,700
Let's fucking push.

The Singapore Grand Prix is brutal.

429

It is a high-speed street circuit.

430
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,300

435
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,280
And didn't bring the win.

436
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,840
This year is
substantially worse than last.

437
